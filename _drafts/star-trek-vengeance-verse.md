title: "On the Star Trek Vengeance Verse: The Kelvin Timeline's Tenuous Ties to Star Trek"
---

Nero, upset at the loss of his home, demanding vengeance upon the Federation whom he
felt stood idly by, and was equally responsible for that loss. Opening a singularity
using stolen technology that had once been the Federation's last, failed, scientific
attempt to save Romulus, Nero thought he could destroy the Federation. [^1] Instead
his quixotic tilting at vast interstellar windmills fractured into a disparate
timeline. One where Nero was at least able to put a mark of vengeance into the
galaxy by imploding Vulcan and nearly imploding Earth.

Three movies in and it seems clear the through arc of the Kelvin Timeline, so named
because the first history changing moment of vengeance wreaked by Nero was the
destruction of the *U.S.S. Kelvin*, is an arc of vengeances against the Federation.

The timeline was built out of the vengeance issues of one megalomaniac and seems
doomed for however long it will last to see ever further megomaniacal attempts at
vengeance and destruction. It is the Star Trek Vengeance Verse. That is its
defining characteristic and its sole reason for being, and that is weird and
not very Star Trek, but also entirely too much like Star Trek.

[^1]:
    *Star Trek Online* and other canon sources tell us he failed in the Prime
    timeline and is barely remembered as a hothead diplomat with a chip on his
    shoulder.

I don't have much in the way of spoilers for *Star Trek Beyond* 
(aka *Trek & Furious*). I enjoyed it, and it was the most Star Trek imbued
film in the Kelvin Timeline, and thus the best Star Trek film in the Kelvin
timeline. Its problems are the Kelvin Timeline's problems, the baggage of
nothing but vengeance plots and attempts to take down and destroy the Federation;
a Federation one would imagine badly hurting with each additional vengeance
attempt. It is a wonder that this Federation is still capable of marvels amongst
the mayhem, and I would like to credit *Beyond* for having some of the best
marvels we have seen in any Star Trek timeline and also one of the better ensemble
films since the TNG era of films. It will come across as faint praise indeed,
but to me *Beyond* was at its best when it felt like the B-Side to 
*Star Trek: Insurrection*. The hard parts being that so much of the ensemble
work still has to rely on Kelvin Timeline baggage and bleed-over from
*The Original Series*. *Beyond* seems to do its best with that to work with,
but more so than ever begs the question on whether or not the the Vengeance
Verse should exist and if it is actually good for Star Trek....
