title: "Three Billboards outside the Resistance Fleet: The Problematic Redemption of Poe Dameron"
---

On the way to watch *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* I took a detour past *Three Billboards
outside Ebbing, Missouri*. (I mean this literally, I was curious if I could catch
a Sunday matinee showing of Star Wars, it was sold out so I watched Three Billboards
instead. Then I watched Star Wars on a late Monday night whim.)

*Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri* is the third major film from writer/director
Martin McDonagh. As a director, Mr. McDonagh draws the best, most nuanced performances
of his career. As a writer, Mr. McDonagh almost nails the catastrophic farce build-up
that the Coens have made a career out of, but yet it felt to me like the weakest
of his three films (behind the fourth wall shenanigans of *Seven Psychopaths* and
the cozy insanity of *In Bruges*), particularly due to its somewhat problematic choices
in a 2017 screenplay. I enjoyed the film, but am not sure it would hold up to multiple
viewings anywhere near as well as *Seven Psychopaths* and *In Bruges* do, and I wasn't
particularly convinced I wanted to see it a second time.

*Star Wars: The Last Jedi* is the fourth major film from writer/director Rian Johnson.
I will admit that I've not been a fan of his films to date, and I especially loathed
*Looper*, of which I spent most of the runtime wondering why I wasn't just watching
*12 Monkeys* instead. I love schlocky time travel stories and managed to watch the
entirety of Hulu's *Future Man*, so this visceral reaction to Mr. Johnson's previous
work had me wondering if I would just wait until *The Last Jedi* was on Netflix,
but I could not resist the porgs and vulptices.

On a scale from *The Phantom Menace* to *Return of the Jedi*, I felt
*Star Wars: The Last Jedi* was somewhere around a *Revenge of the Sith*. [^1]
I enjoyed the film for what it was, but wasn't particularly convinced I'd have reason
or interest to see it a second time. If I do watch a second time, I've got a feeling
I will be making a cut of the film that's pretty much nothing but scenes
of porgs, vulptices, and Chewbacca.

As I've let the films stew in my head, reflecting on both of them, I found some
uncanny resemblances that don't particularly work to *The Last Jedi*'s favor. I'm
going to open with some relatively "minor" qualms, so spoilers for *The Last Jedi*
start immediately, and then we'll of course need to get into *Three Billboards*
spoilers as well.

# Side Qualm: Kylo Ren and the Force Are Terrible

Everything Kylo Ren says, regardless of whatever Mr. Johnson thinks is an "honest"
statement, drips with abuse, and gaslighting. The Force (or at least the Dark Side)
is a terrible liar across film canon, and I will not trust anything Kylo Ren says.

I also will not stand for Rey and Kylo joining forces and if the "Reylo" romance
does happen I promise I will find a way to force lightning torch the entire franchise.

# Side Qualm: The Redemption of Darth Vader is Stupid

One of my oldest qualms with *Star Wars* as a franchise has always been that I
don't think Darth Vader's actions can be redeemed. It's one of the reasons I hugely
burnt out on terrible EU (now "Legacy") books in high school (before the prequels
even came out).

Up to this point, the only film canon hint that Vader is "redeemed" in the eyes of
the Force is the weird implication that only Light Side force weilders somehow
qualify for force ghosts, and some old man pretending to be Vader shows up to
get his Yub Nub on with all the ewoks. Or sometimes there's no Yub Nub and Anakin
Skywalker's third actor is there like Vader was just a bad dream, and now
there's a question of whether force ghosts make any sense at all because it's
still grumpy old Obi-Wan and not cool young Obi-Wan...

*The Last Jedi* is the first movie to explicitly mention (albeit in
passing) the redemption of Darth Vader, which is dumb.

Because *Star Wars* echoes World War II movies (poorly), which is a subject I will
return to, I can't help but use a WWII analogy for how dumb the redemption of
Darth Vader will always be.

Imagine for a second that [Heinrich Himmler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler)
had fought a bit more actively in WWI in, say, Tunisia. Somehow he has a son, and
for reasons that only vaguely make sense at the time a British RAF war buddy/drinking
buddy retires to watch over Himmler's son who stays with Himmler's in-laws in
Tunisia. Anyway, WWII rolls around, Himmler gets busy running the SS, Gestapo, oh
and also fucking concentration camps, meanwhile his son is encouraged by his old
war buddy to enlist in the British Royal Air Force.

Through a crazy set of last ditch efforts in 1945 a desperate British RAF, a rag
tag gang of fighters, and I suppose a circus full of trained bear cubs, manage to
get Himmler, Himmler's hypothetical Tunisian-raised son, and Hitler all in the
same bunker together. Hitler pulls a gun on the hypothetical son, so Himmler kills
Hitler. Somehow this ends the war, because maybe that bunker also had a crazy laser
system or something.

Anyway, even in this weird hypothetical analogy, I'd still be pissed if Himmler
got a "Get Out of Nuremberg War Criminal Trials Free" card simply because he
saved this hypothetical son that day. He still was a mass murderer many times
over. One act of somewhat selfish love, to me, can't possibly balance against genocide,
I don't care what some hazy blue glowing ghost from a Force that supposedly
represents love thinks. Which is why *Star Wars* as a franchise will always
be a problematic fave.

So yeah, *The Last Jedi*, thanks~ for reminding me I guess.

# The Case of Jason Dixon versus Poe Dameron

[^1]:
    That scale is I-VI in order. *Return of the Jedi* has the deaths of many evils
    in the galaxy, including Yoda, and both Jabba, and Boba Fett dying like chumps,
    and yes I will defend my love of ewoks if I must. For further reference, on the
    scale here: *The Force Awakens* is squarely a *Rogue One*, which itself fits
    comfortable in its spot in the opening crawl of Episode IV on the "would watch
    again" side of my III/IV divide.
