title: "Merchant Voyages Are The Highest Stakes in *Sea of Thieves*: Respect Them"
---

I've heard several pirates openly mock the Merchant Voyages in *Sea of Thieves*,
claiming them to be useful only for bored solo players for "easy" or "low risk"
work.

Nay, I tell you! For Merchant Voyages are the highest stakes in the game, and are
truly endgame. The toughest pirates of them all are the ones that fear no snake,
and always deliver on time.

Merchant Voyages are the only voyages that have left me angry enough to ragequit,
multiple times, so it's possible I'm just defensive.

# Narratively the Highest Stakes

In *Sea of Thieves* there are three trading companies ("factions") which offer you
Voyages, the most orderly quests for progression in the game. Of the three I think
it is plainly the Merchants that offer the highest stakes narratively speaking that
the game has to offer in organized play.

The *Gold Hoarders* seek to accumulate gold, and their voyages ask players to
find and dig up the loot of infamous NPC pirates. This is presumably, based
upon their name, to fill a giant vault somewhere in the sea so that some
pirates may dive into said vault to swim in it in the fashion of one Scrooge
McDuck. For all we know, the leader of the Gold Hoarders *is* Scrooge McDuck.
This is a fine goal, but a few coins lost to Davy Jones' locker or stolen by
some other pirate isn't going to slow things down very much or make the
existing hoard any less swimmable.

The *Order of Souls* asks pirates to hunt undead skeleton crews that haunt the
islands, so that they may study their magically infused skulls for Pirate Science.
This is absolutely laudable as a goal. Yet too, any one particular skull isn't
likely to advance the cause much, and skulls stolen by other pirates likely still
help the cause in the end. (Aside: given no obvious citrus fruits in the game,
perhaps it needs an *Order of Scurvy* to fight that dread problem?)

The *Merchants* voyages give you a request from some unseen NPC for an arbitrary
assortment of chickens, pigs, snakes, bananas, gunpowder kegs, etc. At first, these
seem like simple requests, and somewhat silly. But these requests want these things
by a certain date at a certain receiving island. It seems to me that these NPCs are
doing the best they can, with what resources available, to plan parties and feasts
in this age of sail. Each stolen gunpowder keg is one less fireworks display for
a party; each chicken ruthlessly murdered or sunk is one less meal at a feast.

I may pretend to be a heartless pirate sometimes in the game, but I *don't* want
to be the ruin of some kind stranger's party or feast. I take murdered chickens
very seriously, and that is why I have quit with the utmost of rage. You might
think the chickens are silly little annoyances, but these are the game's
toughest stakes. But you don't have to take my word for it, the game itself seems
to agree with me in its progression mechanics.

# Sea of Thieves Progression Primer

Because not everyone may have an intricate love/hate relationship with *Sea of
Thieves* allow me to provide a brief primer on its progression mechanics.
