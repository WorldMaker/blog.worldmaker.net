title: A Game of Vampire Slayers
---

I finally gave up on *Game of Thrones* in the middle of season 5. I
finally gave up on *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* towards the tail end of
season 6. I started into both shows for similar reasons and
I stopped forcing myself to slog through them for very similar reasons,
and it happened withing a couple stressful weeks of each other and it's all
tied together in my head.

Trigger Warning
: Rape, rape culture, domestic violence

Spoiler Warning
: Some references to things that may be considered spoilers

Opinion Warning
: Some unpopular opinions that have gotten people angry with me in the
  past, though I think I've mellowed on them some

Star Warsing
: Really enjoyed *The Force Awakens* and briefly fell back into *SWTOR*

Star Trekking
: Watching more DS9

# The Setup

Frankly, I started into *GoT* and *BtVS* for some notion of "geek cred".
These things are huge and popular "milestones" and I succumbed to peer
pressure. [I've got nothing to
prove](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Rjy5yW1gQ), especially as that
presents most obviously as nerdy white guy I'm not often asked to prove myself,
but peer pressure is a powerful force that affects us all [^1].

Both of these shows required an amount of peer pressure to even try to
watch for the simple reason that I'm just not that interested in their
(related) genres [^2]. In a world full of giant libraries of books,
films, video games, and more entertainment than we can enjoy in a
lifetime, I prefer to stick to my comfort zone: sci-fi and the hope
we can avoid the bad outcomes, maybe navigate towards the good ones.

# The Only Way to Win the Game of Thrones is Not to Play

My problem with *Game of Thrones* is the easier of the two to explore.
I watched the show to avoid reading the books. I was avoiding reading
the books because they would make me feel like an asshole. The show
made me worry I was an assh, and I got to the point I couldn't
stomach it.

I can see in GoT the deconstructions of a lot of fantasy tropes, the
deep worldbuilding and good ideas. That becomes a problem because
that meant when I was watching it I felt like I could predict it.
I do that a lot, and it usually doesn't make me feel like an asshole.

Among others, I predicted the events of the Red Wedding. I found it
almost boring.

I had no sympathy for any of the characters and many characters I
never would have kept track of, for a couple seasons while I was
watching the show, if it weren't for the Xbox "Smart Glass" app with
character summaries.

I'm not sure which of the two made me feel like the bigger asshole, but
the combination was unsettling. The show is a giant asshole measuring
contest, and I found it hard to watch it, and not think the asshole
was me for understanding the shitty inhumane acts of its characters, but
failing to find any sympathy for what little the show bothered to showcase
of their humanity.

I maintain that without knowledge of the books and/or something like
Xbox "Smart Glass" the show is practically unwatchable. Characters
show up out of nowhere, and narratives plod at inconsistent paces that
even binge watching fail to make tolerable. Lacking the classic television
device called "recaps" the show makes callbacks that lose almost entirely
all their weight. *Westworld* did a fantastic job with its recaps. *GoT*
left it's recaps to apps like "Smart Glass" and suffers thereby, in my
view.

I stuck with the show for five seasons, not enjoying the show, and
watching it out of some weird idea of fan duty trying to keep up with my peers,
and feeling like an asshole for knowing the worst of how the show's characters
think, and not having any way to vent that but anger and/or boredom.

The anger got to be too much. *GoT* passed from beyond being not
fun for me to watch, but had pushed too many of my buttons to keep
me from far too stressful levels of anger for what should have been
escapism time.

# Buffy and the Relationships from Hell

*Buffy the Vampire Slayer* at least had good recaps, didn't randomly
introduce characters, made character through arcs clear, and paced
follow ups like you would expect from the medium of classic episodic
with some serial storytelling television. I never felt bored watching
*BtVS*.

I did feel a lot of anger, though. *BtVS* was full of too many
assholes and I just wanted to burn it down, from pretty early on.

The anger comes from the very metaphors at the heart of the show.
*BtVS* used monsters as amplified allegories for the problems faced
by (at first) high schoolers. Regardless of any mismatch to my
personal lived experience [^3], I can read allegory.

I **hate** Angel, Riley, and Spike. These seem so clearly, to me,
as terrible metaphors for different degrees of domestic violence,
rape, gaslighting, and abuses of power (hundreds of years old guys dating high schoolers).
The fact that Buffy could take care of herself, in theory if not in the show's practice,
doesn't excuse how literally monstrous and problematic all three
of the men Buffy dated were.

At so many turns the show excuses terrible behavior. "But he has a *soul*";
"He won't be so violent when he gets his *soul* back"; etc. It's not
just romanticizing the "bad boy" stereotype, it's romanticizing the
bipolar terror of domestic abuse; the "kind soul" presented as public
face, and the monster behind the curtain.

The squickiness in the power dynamics of *Dollhouse* are clearly on
display and have led to some interesting discussions about their
problems. It's fascinating how clearly its allegory lends itself to
dissection. On the other hand, I find it *very* tough to have frank
discussions about the problematic aspects of these particular characters.
All three have adamant defenders that will go to bat for every
problematic action by these characters, or worse just excuse things
"because he's hot". The show goes out of its way to continually
"redeem" these characters, and people forget or ignore that these
characters are all **monsters**.

I meant to post this article a couple years ago, it's been sitting in my
drafts folder for a while. In finishing out this article in 2017, I can't
help but point to the [problematic parts of Joss Whedon's own character](https://www.themarysue.com/kai-cole-joss-whedon-hypocrisy/)
being reflected here somewhat directly in these problematic relationships.

# Buffy Tried to Have Her Allegorical Cake and Eat it too

Let's crane shot out to the rest of the crew. *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*
has **no** healthy romantic relationship by the end of season six, and
retcons any of the ones that may have seemed roughly healthy, some having
previously lasted several seasons, effectively out of existence.

It's not a requisite of entertainment to feature healthy relationships
at all. Certainly that isn't always dramatically interesting. But for a
show so largely about its relationships, and how supposedly the core
"scooby gang" is meant to
