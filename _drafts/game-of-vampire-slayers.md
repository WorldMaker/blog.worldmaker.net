Spoiler Warning

Star Warsing
: Really enjoyed *The Force Awakens* and fell back into *SWTOR*
Star Trekking
: Watching more DS9

I finally gave up on *Game of Thrones* in the middle of season 5. I
finally gave up on *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* towards the tail end of
season 6. I started into both shows for essentially the same reason and
I stopped forcing myself to slog through them for very similar reasons.

# The Setup

Frankly, I started into *GoT* and *BtVS* for some notion of "geek cred".
These things are huge and popular "milestones" and I succumbed to peer
pressure. [I've got nothing to
prove](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Rjy5yW1gQ), especially as a
mostly obvious nerdy white guy I'm not often asked to prove myself,
but peer pressure is a powerful force that affects us all [^1]. 

Both of these shows required an amount of peer pressure to even try to
watch for the simple reason that I'm just not that interested in their
(related) genres [^2]. In a world full of giant libraries of books,
films, video games, and more entertainment than we can enjoy in a
lifetime,
