title: "Videogames and the Shibboleths of Sex"
---

Welcome to *Videogamers Pseudonymous*, a many more than twelve steps program
because an end cap of twelve in a level treadmill is barely an appetizer.

Hi, I'm Max and I'm a videogamer.

*WorldMaker* is my "gamer tag" on a number of services, and also the name of
my Videogame Developer Impostor Syndrome. (I've been working on this for a
few years now. I am not defined by my lack of successes.)

Today's level here at *Videogamers Pseudonymous* is about sex, so pardon me
while I reveal more about my sexuality than **I** feel comfortable publicly
discussing (and hence the attempt at humor in this *Videogamers Pseudonymous*
framing narrative). I won't blame anyone for checking out here.

My sexuality is its own ball of overlapping impostor syndromes, most of which
are not relevant to the discussion at hand. (I'm also only much more recent in
trying to deal with or come to terms with my sexuality. I wish I'd given a lot
of it much more thought decades ago.) The relevant broad term, is that in
the real world [^1] my sexuality is easiest defined with the term *asexual*.
This is not a term that I find entirely useful because it says more about what
my sexuality *is not* than what it maybe is. It too, is a label of an impostor
syndrome, and in a sex-obsessed society and culture I am but an impostor by the
differences even in the way my mind and its endorphin rewards are wired.

A more constructive place to start is that I suppose that I could describe my
sexuality as "Bioware Protagonist". I want to be surrounded by friends that are
family [^2]. I want to listen to their past adventures. I want to go off on new
adventures together. I want to flirt in safe spaces and get pretty icons to
flash when those options are available and maybe when those options land, and
definitely when the flirting happens in the other direction because I can't always
seem to naturally read it. Sometimes, I want the option to push things to heavy
petting, kissing, holding hands, maybe "second base"... and that's about as far
as I naturally feel interest to go in real life. But mostly I just want the
small moments that Bioware's writers and animators put so much love into: sitting
on a couch together discussing nothing of much importance, sharing a meal,
watching a movie, drinking in a bar...

In videogames, from indie visual novels to giant AAA blockbusters such as Bioware's
latest *Mass Effect: Andromeda*, these sorts of small social moments and at most
the heavy petting, the T&A, and the intimate cuddling of second base *are* sex,
and I finally realize that to me, too, that's what qualifies, that's what I want
[^3]. The issue of course, is that these things, too, are used as narrative
shibboleths (stand-ins, symbols) for the act of sex itself.

The obvious criticism which many others have covered well over the years is the
criticism that ludic simplicity of these relationships and these moments (as
opposed to the narrative complexity of building friendships over time and
exploring friend's feelings and interests and wants and desires), cheapens the
notion of sex itself, simplifying things to an absurd "make the right choices,
get 'sex' out". There's the obvious ties to that sense of "nice guy" entitlement
that the maximum a guy needs to get sex is say and do the right things to a girl
for long enough and sex should be the reward for such behavior. [^4]

Allow me to push on from that to a less obvious criticism that I've been feeling
very personally about for the last few months as I try to figure out my own path
in a number of complex confusions and realizations.

There is a problem here in that using simpler, more mainstream palatable,
social activities, and "second base" as shibboleths for sex in videogames
(and movies and television, for that matter), also serves to make these things
more *expensive*. By conflating these things too with sex, we rob them of their
own individual nature. We start to see pursuing social intimacy [^5] as one and
the same, kit and bundle, with sex itself. We start to require and associate,
culturally, nearly the same costs and risk assessments and commitment needs to
private, social intimate relationships as we do to sexual relationships. [^6]

I suppose I've always known the difference here, as theory, but I feel like
I've only recently started to comprehend the consequences. So many people focus
themselves on that long cut to black that most actually represents sex in a
videogame. Everything else is the journey to that, the ludic grind to that few
minutes of black screen in a videogame, and the drawn out prerequisites and
homework to get there.

So far as I've discovered, most of the ways we have to discuss these things, if
we discuss them at all, are indirect at best, and themselves so deeply couched
in being a "mere" part of the journey: second base is a pit stop in a baseball
game. [^7] Sex is "going all the way". Sit-com characters and bad comedians of
all stripes complain about dates or spouses or significant others that want to
spend too much time, in their eyes, making the journey and not enough at the
"destination", as if one is onerous and the other only the real part. [^8]

If those spots along the "journey" to sex were so easy, we'd have better names
for them wouldn't we? It seems to me strange how much of our evolution as a
social species implies we need some of these things somewhat commonly, but our
culture doesn't deign to give them stronger individual identities and names, merely
lumping them together into a big box labelled sex and stuffed into the mental
equivalent of an attic until "the one" arrives to unbox it for us.

Is it any wonder we so many parts of our society get so worked up about kissing
and cuddling as if they were sex when we can't separate them in videogames, or
TV, or movies? When we don't seem to have good culturally approved ways for
asking for them other than the complicated worlds of sex and dating?

I still don't have a lot of good answers yet. I'm still trying to find my fit,
my peace, my moments of intimacy, in this culture of ours.

In a monogamy-obsessed culture, how can a person that doesn't necessarily
"go all the way" ever compete to be "the one"? "The one" that meets every need
of a partner; that becomes a partner's whole world? This alone is a terrible
impostor syndrome to face. At least in a Bioware RPG like *Mass Effect* I know
that I can savor every tiny bit of relationship as I can with the clan of
compatriots that I find there, whether or not I "go all the way" through with
any of them... and even if I do go "all the way" with one of them, the M-Rating
and I only really go to somewhere near "second base".

    I don't think I'm very good at explaining what those moments mean to me in
    real life, and vocally appreciating what opportunities I get, because I
    become busy just trying to enjoy them while they briefly last... That's
    something I hope to work on in a long list of things I feel a need to find a
    better vocabulary for. While such events are rarely described as "orgasmic",
    that discounts the endorphin rush of good social interaction. Maybe I'm just
    more sensitive to it for many reasons, including my minority sexuality, but I
    find it troubling we don't have good words for it, that we don't culturally
    make a bigger deal of it, that we discount its importance in our lives (as
    members of a socially evolved species that needs it even as a part of our
    survival).

    Aside: why is this so much a thing? It's not like the ludic simplicity of
    flying a plane or starship in an arcade dogfighter has given so many guys
    an impression that flying a plane or starship in real life would be nearly
    as straightforward.

    I have issues with the use of the word "platonic" here, which is a different

   I've never quite understood those 'jokes', even before I started processing my
