Six weeks ago my hair was longer.

Things remain so surreal that perhaps I should provide some context
because I can think of no other time in my life where that might be
some sort of profound statement that feels so confessional and almost
guilty to write. Maybe I can explain why I find it a bold opening
gambit to start a rambling confessional blog post.

Four weeks ago my home state, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, moved to
a healthy at home, social distancing lock down due to a global virus
pandemic (scientifically and boringly labeled COVID-19). Other states
have been managing at their own pace. A large group of my friends even
in other states, regardless of state policies, have been healthy at
home for exactly as long as I have, because five weeks ago many of us
were busy having [the last best time](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2020/03/28/the-last-best-time/)
together. Our immediate return to the real world in one way or another
was greeted with a strong push to self-isolate as much as possible for
at least two weeks. In my case a lot of my state did too, others didn't.

My calendar on Monday this week still shows the hair cut appointment
I scheduled six weeks ago, though I didn't go because hair stylists
aren't essential services and thus are closed under current executive
orders in this state. I had scheduled it this week both because I
tend to schedule my hair cuts generally five to six weeks apart,
and this Saturday is my birthday, along with other plans canceled.

It is a common topic of conversation right now among many friends on
Facebook and in Zoom video chat gatherings to discuss home hair cuts,
either very recent experiments or soon to happen desperation of one
sort or another.

Six weeks ago my hair was longer than it is right now. I am an
outlier in these conversations. The lengthening hair on my head
is not a source of anxiety or annoyance because it was longer
six weeks ago. I'm fine if it gets longer again.

I lament that Monday's hair cut appointment was canceled some for
the semblance of normalcy it might have offered, and the chance
to tell someone I've shared so many vacation stories some new ones.
But maybe for perhaps the first time in my life I'm not worried
about the length of my hair this week. Let it grow. It was longer
just six weeks ago when I went for my pre-vacation hair cut.

According to my calendar that appointment was nearly seven months
since my previous hair cut. After years of mostly clockwork 5-6 week
appointments, I intentionally skipped a couple, out of a combination
of anxieties about short term finances. Then that snowballed into
procrastination, dealing with other sorts of anxieties and fears,
