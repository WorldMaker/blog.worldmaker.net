title: "The Musical Identity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: The Composers of The Avengers"
----

A lot of people have watched the *Every Frame a Painting* video that claims that
the Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't have much of a musical identity, and that
has come to dominate the conversation about music and the use of music in the MCU,
to I think the detriment of film criticism because so many people just stop there
where EFAP left the ball (in a surprisingly negative place). That EFAP video
deserves a proper rebuttal, but unfortunately I'm not a strong video essayist.
I hope this prose essay might encourage some video essayists themselves to
explore the ideas further.

EFAP spends a majority of its time particularly punching down on the first
*Thor* film, which I think particularly speaks to that essay's weakness. Like
the character himself, Thor takes three movies, with three directors, and three
very different composers to find his musical identity (it was inside Thor all
along). In a weird way that does thematically speak to heart of the musical
identity of the MCU: Marvel Studios has let each individual film find the
musical identity right for its characters, their genre, and their arc in the series.
I think it is a mistake to call this MCU approach "safe" or "boring", as it has
meant some risks and experiments that feel less risky in hindsight only because
they've worked so well. As *Thor* illustrates, not every score has been incredible,
but there are interesting heights in the series, perhaps most interesting because
folks don't notice how close to the sun they got.

Relatedly, a lot of people seem disappointed that the MCU didn't constrain the
musical framework enough that you can play any Avenger's "theme" in any film and
have it work. Certainly *Star Wars* has cast a large shadow (borrowed from
Wagner) of endless repetitions of variations on the same leitmotifs that largely
work in any context, and that's an approach that something like the MCU could
have taken. I think what the MCU has brought to theaters is a much more
interesting tapestry than that approach would have allowed. Sometimes that's
discordant in juxtaposition, but the Avengers themselves don't always
work together perfectly, and that's thematically appropriate.

Rather than focus on specific film scores, for me its easiest to center the discussion
around some of the composers that have been assembled to back the Avengers on their
journeys.

# Alan Silvestri

Alan Silvestri is a heavy hitter in the genre canon, having scored so many favorite
films such as *Back to the Future*, *The Predator*, and more. Silvestri was
brought into the MCU relatively "late" to the MCU to score
*Captain America: The First Avenger* and *The Avengers*, the fifth and sixth movies
to close out "Phase 1". Yet, I feel like Silvestri clearly has to be addressed first
when discussing the musical identity of the MCU.

Silvestri has been the most unifying force in the MCU musical identity, both directly
and indirectly. First of all, as the composer behind three of the four Avengers
team ups, and especially the first one, it was directly left to Silvestri's
expertise to bind together the tapestry. It is said in interviews that Silvestri
tried very hard to find Themes or at least leitmotifs for each individual Avenger,
and to find a way to bring full circle the musical identities of all of them into
a cohesive, standardized whole. I find it fascinating that Alan Silvestri is
probably counted among the fans disappointed there isn't a universal musical
framework for the MCU movies. But it also seems clear that it was Silvestri's
expertise that wound up convinced that it wouldn't work and the MCU was better
leaning into the diversity that defined its "Phase 1" than forcing future phases
into a more unified framework.

Secondly, and perhaps, most importantly, Silvestri composed *the* Theme. I feel
there is no better rebuttal that there is at least one memorable, hum-able, and
sometimes ear worm infectious theme in the MCU than Silvestri's *Avengers Theme*.

If you need a reminder, I particularly love the cover of the theme by Mariachi
Entertainment System (and its then timely dedication to the passing of Stan Lee):

In addition to being a great cover, I love that the video directly juxtaposes two
other beloved Marvel themes from previous decades. As many people claim to have
never noticed the Avengers theme, much less agree with me that it almost directly
produces goosebumps that heroic assembly is about to happen or is in the process
of happening, I'm clearly not the only one that thinks the Avengers Theme will
stand the test of time.

The Avengers Theme makes an appearance directly or indirectly in almost every MCU
film following *The Avengers*. Some themes in the MCU want to be The Avengers theme
when they grow up. (I'll return to that.) Captain America's themes are obviously
directly related, because Silvestri built them that way.

On the earworm front, I do know a trick to get the Avengers Theme stuck in an
MCU fan's head. There's a particular pregnant pause in the Theme that people always
want to hear resolve (used to great effect in particular in *Infinity War* where
it doesn't resolve exactly satisfactorily), and just a surprisingly few notes
lead there. (Studies show it's that seeking a tune to resolve that is often a
strong cause of earworms.)

# Ramin Djawadi

The first composer to leave a mark on the MCU was Ramin Djawadi. Ramin Djawadi
is best known today for some really exciting stuff on *Westworld*, but also
projects like *Game of Thrones*, and *Pacific Rim*.
