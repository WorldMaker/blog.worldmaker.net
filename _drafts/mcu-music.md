title: "The Musical Identity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: The Composers of The Avengers"

A lot of people have watched the *Every Frame a Painting* video that claims that
the Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't have much of a musical identity, and that
has come to dominate the conversation about music and the use of music in the MCU,
to I think the detriment of its film criticism because so many people just stop there
where EFAP left the ball (in a surprisingly negative place for EFAP). That EFAP video
deserves a proper rebuttal, but unfortunately I'm not a strong video essayist.
I hope this prose essay might encourage some video essayists themselves to
explore the ideas further.

EFAP spends a majority of its time particularly punching down on the first
*Thor* film, which I think particularly speaks to that essay's weakness. Like
the character himself, Thor takes three movies, with three directors, and three
very different composers to find his musical identity (it was inside Thor all
along). In a weird way that does thematically speak to heart of the musical
identity of the MCU: Marvel Studios has let each individual film find the
musical identity right for its characters, their genre, and their arc in the series.
I think it is a mistake to call this MCU approach "safe" or "boring", as it has
meant some risks and experiments that feel less risky in hindsight only because
they've worked so well. As *Thor* illustrates, not every score has been incredible,
but there are interesting heights in the series, perhaps most interesting because
folks don't notice how close to the sun they got.

Relatedly, a lot of people seem disappointed that the MCU didn't constrain the
musical framework enough that you can play any individual hero's "theme" in any
film and have it work. Certainly *Star Wars* has cast a large shadow (borrowed from
Wagner) of endless repetitions of variations on the same leitmotifs that largely
work in any context, and that's an approach that something like the MCU could
have taken. I think what the MCU has brought to theaters is a much more
interesting tapestry than that approach would have allowed. Sometimes that's
discordant in juxtaposition, but the Avengers themselves don't always
work together perfectly, and that's thematically appropriate as well.

Rather than focus on specific film scores, for me its easiest to center the discussion
around some of the composers that have been assembled to back the Avengers on their
journeys.

# Alan Silvestri

Alan Silvestri is a heavy hitter in the genre canon, having scored so many favorite
films such as *Back to the Future*, *The Predator*, and more.[^1] Silvestri was
brought into the MCU relatively "late" to the MCU to score
*Captain America: The First Avenger* and *The Avengers*, the fifth and sixth movies
to close out "Phase 1". Yet, I feel like Silvestri clearly has to be addressed first
when discussing the musical identity of the MCU.

Silvestri has been the most unifying force in the MCU musical identity, both directly
and indirectly. First of all, as the composer behind three of the four Avengers
team ups, and especially the first one, it was directly left to Silvestri's
expertise to bind together the tapestry. It is said in interviews that Silvestri
tried very hard to find Themes or at least leitmotifs for each individual Avenger,
and to find a way to bring full circle the musical identities of all of them into
a cohesive, standardized whole. I find it fascinating that Alan Silvestri is
probably counted among the fans disappointed there isn't a universal musical
framework for the MCU movies. But it also seems clear that it was Silvestri's
expertise that wound up convinced that it wouldn't work and the MCU was better
leaning into the diversity that defined its "Phase 1" than forcing future phases
into a more unified framework.

Secondly, and perhaps, most importantly, Silvestri composed *the* Theme. I feel
there is no better rebuttal that there is at least one memorable, hum-able, and
sometimes ear worm infectious theme in the MCU than Silvestri's *Avengers Theme*.

If you need a reminder, I particularly love the cover of the theme by Mariachi
Entertainment System (and its then timely dedication to the passing of Stan Lee):

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKwyYouf5lY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

In addition to being a great cover, I love that the video directly juxtaposes two
other beloved Marvel themes from previous decades.[^2] As many people claim to have
never noticed the Avengers theme, much less agree with me that it almost directly
produces goosebumps that heroic assembly is about to happen or is in the process
of happening, I'm clearly not the only one that thinks the Avengers Theme will
stand the test of time.

The Avengers Theme makes an appearance directly or indirectly in almost every MCU
film following *The Avengers*. Some themes in the MCU want to be The Avengers theme
when they grow up. (I'll return to that.) Captain America's themes are obviously
directly related, because Silvestri built them that way.

On the earworm front, I do know a trick to get the Avengers Theme stuck in an
MCU fan's head. There's a particular pregnant pause in the Theme that people always
want to hear resolve (used to great effect in particular in *Infinity War* where
it doesn't resolve exactly satisfactorily), and just a surprisingly few notes
lead there. (Studies show it's that seeking a tune to resolve that is often a
strong cause of earworms.)

# Ramin Djawadi

The first composer to leave a mark on the MCU was Ramin Djawadi. Djawadi
is best known today for some really exciting stuff on *Westworld*, but also
projects like *Game of Thrones*, and *Pacific Rim*.

The Iron Man films are something of the opposite case from the Thor films. Where
the Thor films took three directors, three composers, and three films to find their
musical voice: Iron Man films know their musical identity from the very first film.
Even with two directors and three different composers, across the three films, they
all feel like Iron Man film scores.

I think a key to that musical identity is something that is often overlooked, but
becomes a recurring theme in the MCU, and it seems something that Djawadi was very
aware of in setting the template in the first *Iron Man*: Iron Man **has** a
theme, and practically everyone is aware of it. The theme for Iron Man was written
by Ozzy Osbourne and performed by Black Sabbath. A lot of the score of the first
*Iron Man* seems to be very intentionally building up to that iconic "I am Iron
Man" moment.

The score does nearly everything shy of a complete deconstruction and/or reorchestration
of Black Sabbath's "Iron Man". After Djawadi's work on *Westworld* we can wish we
had gotten a full orchestral treatment of that song in the score, being without
something so very direct, it's easy to pick out a lot of indirect clues in the score.
(It's a great suggestion for any future Iron Man films, Disney's Marvel Studios
could afford the fees to do a full reorchestration unlike the Marvel Studio
skunkworks that made the first *Iron Man*. While we are making such wishes, maybe
find an excuse for a Wild West time travel plot to get a Player Piano version
as well.)

*Iron Man* establishes from early in the MCU direct ties between the chosen soundtrack
and the film's score. It's easy to miss character themes when they are pop songs.
Not every Iron Man film licenses Black Sabbath, but the shadow it casts on the scores
carries through all the same.

It was somewhat controversial at the time for a superhero film to use a "rock"
soundtrack instead of something more classically "soaring"/"superheroic", and the
MCU's Producers themselves saw it as a risk, according to interviews. It was
also a risk of being too "on the nose" to license a pop song like "Iron Man"
from Black Sabbath for the soundtrack. The MCU has taken soundtrack and score
risks from the very first film, and it worked so well most people didn't notice.
(Fans were likely too busy being entertained to notice the risks musically.)

# Tyler Bates

Tyler Bates has a resume full of mostly action films and action franchises such as
*John Wick*. Bates tackles arguably one of the tougher roles in the MCU, in the
two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, simply because they are so soundtrack-first.
Star Lord's "70's Dad Rock" mix tapes dominates the films so much in the viewer's
conscious mind, that it is almost easy to forget they even have a score.

It's easy to argue that the scores can rest on being somewhat "generic action film"
scores as that 70's Dad Rock does so much of the heavy lifting. But they do make
some risks, and arguably setup some of the music games that other cosmic MCU
films will play with. (Between the score and soundtrack of Guardians, it seems
somewhat obvious with hindsight how most of the rest of MCU cosmic almost "must"
settle on 80s/90s synth-heavy fun, kind of splitting the difference between
Guardians and the rest of the MCU.)

I have one particular piece to the Guardians scores that I particularly think
people most often overlook, which is that they contain maybe the second most
important theme. The Guardian of the Galaxy team theme, which I argue is
particularly great because it sounds so much like it was written to sound like
it wants to be The Avengers theme when it grows up:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQ4WLvj5ODE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

It's slightly less harmonious, maybe a little bit more discordant. Just like the
Guardians team itself. I think it says a lot about the MCU that where themes
make the most sense, it's in describing a *team*.

If there has been a major risk in the MCU, differentiating the MCU from past
superhero films, it has been in putting together team ups. I don't feel it
should be surprising that teams are so important to the MCU's musical identity.

(I think a direct one-two counterpoint of this theme and The Avengers theme is
maybe the one obvious missing mashup game that Alan Silvestri could have
attempted in *Infinity War* or *Endgame*.)

# Michael Giacchino

Michael Giacchino is possibly one of the hardest working nerds[^3] in Hollywood
scores right now. His resume includes everything from some of the best of Pixar
and Disney, to being the "house" composer for a lot of Bad Robot's efforts.
Whether or not I plan to buy it, when I see that Giacchino scored a film I look
up the score album, because his track titles are full of dad jokes, groaner puns,
and sometimes raw, informative commentary on the film that adds its own interesting
layer. Giacchino's contributions to the MCU include *Doctor Strange* and *Spider-Man*.

*Doctor Strange* is one of my least favorite MCU films and most favorite MCU scores.
Giacchino seems to have a lot of fun hamming it up with elements from the trippier,
more acid-coated and world-hopping, B-Sides in the catalog of *The Beatles*, and
it's basically perfect for the character. The score does a lot to keep the film
trippy and more light-hearted.

*Spider-Man: Homecoming* acknowledges from the studio titles immediately at the
start of the film that *everyone* knows Spider-Man has a theme song and can hum
along. Giacchino welcomed home Spider-Man to the MCU with exactly what every
fan wanted: a full reorchestration of the 1960's TV theme (juxtaposed as/with the
modern Marvel Studios theme). The score doesn't use that theme directly anywhere
else in the film, but again like *Iron Man* you can hear that it feels related and
perhaps in service to it. (The score does more directly evoke Silvestri's
Avengers theme several times.)

# Very Honorable Mentions

In lieu of an unreadably lengthy essay, allow me to condense in passing some of the
other composers that I absolutely could have devoted ever more paragraphs to:

* *Black Panther*'s Ludwig Göransson and the collaboration with Kendrick Lamar
* *Thor: Ragnarok*'s Mark Mothersbaugh, and Taika Waititi realizing/discovering that
  Thor's theme is Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song"
* *Captain Marvel*'s Pinar Toprak
* Mike Post's Theme from *Caged Heat*
* Christoph Beck's work on *Ant-Man* and *Ant-Man and the Wasp*
* Brian Taylor's Phase 2 the Good, the Bad, and the Repetitive "trilogy" of
  *Iron Man 3*, *Thor: The Dark World*, and *Age of Ultron*. The most direct
  proof I can offer that a "cohesive framework" or "single composer" would have
  probably have been a poor choice for the MCU. Though I still like these
  contributions more than my snark here suggests.

Admittedly, most of the best scores are most of the more recent, but the "one movie
at a time" spirit that allows them to play and to risk, encourages a game of
oneupmanship. It's almost to be expected that each film be better musically than
the last. I also don't think that it would have happened without a lot of that
"DNA" going back all the way to the experiments and risks of "Phase 1".

# What I Consider The Keys to the MCU Musical Identity

I think there are a couple key takeways from the MCU musical identity:

1. Capital-T Themes used more than once are generally more for Team Ups.
2. Where MCU heroes have Themes, they are sometimes pop songs. (Iron Man has
   Black Sabbath. Thor finds Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song". Spider-Man remembers
   his TV Theme. Star Lord has 70's Dad Rock.)
3. It's harder to divorce the scores from the licensed soundtracks in the MCU,
   than a lot of similar other genre works.
4. There are a lot of different composers and the focus is typically "one film
   at a time", but there are still some grand risks in the service of individual
   films, and they do all seem to be in conversation with each other, even if not
   as directly as some fans wish.

There's a lot of variety in music genres. I think there are more gems and hits
than misses. I understand where people are coming from when citing EFAP and
calling the MCU musicly drab, but I do not agree.

[^1]: Admittedly, a reason as well that the Avengers films' soundtracks may sound
  generic. Silvestri defined so much of the genre's sound over the decades that a
  lot of scores sound like Silvestri.

[^2]: When the X-Men finally show up in the MCU, I very much expect them to bring
  the 90's TV Theme with them. That would fit the MCU well.
