<p>Woke up early, invigorated.  Headed out the door and discovered some
jackass had egged my car overnight.  On the fortunate side was that I
had woke up early and headed out the door...  otherwise I might not
have noticed until Tuesday or Wednesday.  Also fortunate it was
raining today, keeping it from getting too hard, other than the fact
that I felt like an idiot using a car wash on a rainy day.</p>
<p>I park on the street (because we have 4 cars between a 2-car garage
and a small driveway), and the obvious explanation is just the fact
that jackasses hate that I park on the street because it does a little
bit to slow down the 45+ MPH traffic flow on a supposedly 15 MPH speed
limit neighborhood street, but people use it as a damn shortcut
between Hurstbourne Road and Shelbyville Road...  I've even seen
semi-trucks do that and it's fucking ridiculous.  Oh my gosh, people
are parking in the street in a suburban neighborhood!  People wonder
why I have such a low opinion of just about everything related to the
modern car...  I guess someone took their holiday traffic angst out on
my car.</p>
