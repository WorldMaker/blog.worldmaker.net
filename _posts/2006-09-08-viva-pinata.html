<p>The Viva Pinata cartoon show starts tomorrow at 9:30 on &quot;4Kids TV&quot;, aka Fox.  I've been watching the episodes available on the Xbox Marketplace, and its an amusing kids show with a great animation style and some very weird jokes and puns.  Viva Pinata is one of the most interesting announced holiday releases for the 360 and I think that I'll probably buy it.</p>
