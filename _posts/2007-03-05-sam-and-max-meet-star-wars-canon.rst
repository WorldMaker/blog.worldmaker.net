title: Sam and Max meet Star Wars Canon
---
I certainly gave up on Star Wars (which I have since the last film pronounced "dead to me"), but I am glad that there are still some fun to be found in the "Expanded Universe" (C-Canon and S-Canon works).  (I can no longer stand and in some cases outright hate G-Canon.)  Here's the thing that amused me recently: `Max <http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Max_%28lagomorph%29>`_ (Wookieepedia) of `Sam and Max <http://www.samandmax.net>`_ (Ye old unofficial fan site from my old `International House of Mojo <http://www.mixnmojo.com/>`_ stomping grounds, from `whence <http://www.mixnmojo.com/php/news/showfile.php?id=2255&category=lucasfilmnews>`_ this is via, btw) is considered (C-)canon in Star Wars, due to lending his bounty-hunting skills as a sidekick to Kyle Katarn in DF:JK for a couple of missions...  Dark Forces (the first game, not the Jedi Knight follow-ups) is still one of the few Star Wars computer games I recall fondly.
