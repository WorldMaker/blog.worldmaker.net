title: Firefox Tricks
---
<p>Recently introduced to <a class="reference external" href="http://vimperator.mozdev.org/">Vimperator</a>, an addon for Firefox that makes Firefox more like Vim, which is amazingly useful for keyboard-based browsing.  Nothing like being able to navigate pages from the home row (unei style for Colemak, with a bit of remapping).  Try it, but because it completely mangles Firefox's keyboard shortcuts and some of Firefox's UI you may want to try it in a separate profile first.</p>
<p>Which is my second trick: <em>Firefox Profiles</em>.  I used to think these were a vestigial organ from Netscape used only by corporate types.  Then I realized that I had two good uses of them and that shut me up.  First I've become one of those people that have an extremely long running session and keep something around 10-20 tabs open that come back when I relaunch Firefox.  I actually find that useful, but there is one scenario where that becomes an issue: roaming wireless.  Many wireless networks have &quot;welcome&quot; or &quot;sign-in&quot; pages that redirect you on first connection.  I created a &quot;clear&quot; profile that opens to a blank page specifically for unknown wireless networks where I want to wait to pull up my long running session until after I know they won't be redirected.  The other use is that I decided to move my addons like Firebug and YSlow to a separate profile to keep them from taking up memory when I'm just surfing.</p>
<p>To set up a new profile run <tt class="docutils literal">firefox <span class="pre">-ProfileManager</span></tt> which gives you the normally hidden profile GUI.  To start Firefox with a different profile you can create a shortcut with <tt class="docutils literal">firefox <span class="pre">-p</span> <span class="pre">&lt;profile-name&gt;</span></tt>.</p>
