title: The Pink Godzilla Online Dev Kit on the Xbox 360

<p>One of the original reasons I chose XNA as my development platform was for the benefit of Xbox builds and debugging.  With my original choice for network library I was unable to run it on the Xbox.  Thus it was one of the ancillary benefits in my <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/2008/mar/07/design-decision-xna-network-or-not-xna-network/">choice to change networking libraries</a>.</p>
<p>I've been working with an Xbox build (of the game that I've been working on for months) for a couple of days now and it's been great for debugging network code already.  Doing remote debugging of an Xbox build in Visual Studio is pretty amazing every time I do it, and I know that the XNA team at Microsoft put a lot of work into that.  It's quite interesting to set breakpoints for the Xbox build or to do post-mortem debugging.</p>
<p>I was asked to take a few photos of the Xbox build in action and I decided to go ahead and share those on my blog as well, because I do feel at a decent point to brag about where things are, to put things in perspective compared to how the rest of the time I end up worrying about where things need to be.  I apologize for the quality of the photos, I only have a cheap digital camera at my disposal, and the angle of the photos (I couldn't find a better way to reduce glare and I couldn't turn off the flash without losing the camera's auto-focus apparently)...  I am not a professional photographer.</p>
