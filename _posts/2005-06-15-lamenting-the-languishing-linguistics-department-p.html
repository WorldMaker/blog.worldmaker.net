title: Lamenting the Languishing Linguistics Department, Part Two
---
<p>On the tails of what I wrote yesterday I chanced into an interesting conversation today about it...</p>

<p>This freshman English teacher (teaching 102) was sitting on the steps of the Humanities building smoking while her class was busy, and I was on break.  I reminisced, "Yeah, I had one of those a while ago...  hmm, I took 105."  She responded, "Ah, you are an honors student...", and I sheepishly looked at my shoes and cut in with, "Well, I was."  I then had to explain to her how my GPA was scrambled over in the Engineering courses and that my real draw/passion for it lies closer to the linguistic/creative edge than the mathematical/science edge.  She then went through most of the questions I had asked myself in last night's blog post.  It was such glorious irony, I guess, to have someone else ask them of me.</p>

<p>She lamented the University's lack of strength when it came to the cross-disciplinary arts, and reminded me of how what little remained of the Linguistics department had been poorly smashed into her own English department.  She then pointed out that the ex-head of the Linguistics department was someone that I would do well to meet, and that the University was so poorly utilizing his skills because he was now doing menial work in the Communications department!</p>

<p>Just very interesting to see my own self-discussion revisited in conversation no more than eight or nine hours after I wrote it.</p>
