title: The Straczynski Questions
---
<p>I noticed that in the "fluff" symbolic and introspective play I've been writing (think Meta-War as an actionless play, perhaps) I've been bandying about the Straczynski Questions, but not forthright answering them.  The Questions, which can be very deep, are used in the Babylon 5 series and associated works as major symbolic devices.  In commentary, Straczynski has said that he also uses the Questions in determining a character's objective and superobjective (using the terms associated with Stanislavski's System of Acting).  These are (in order of symbolic usage (which should be obvious, and thus non spoiler)):</p>

<ul>
<li>Who <i>are</i> you?</li>
<li>What do you want?</li>
<li>Where are you going?</li>
<li>In whom do you trust?</li>
<li>For whom do you serve?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions continue to affect my own writing.  Even if in this particularly play I am working on none of the questions is really given their due, other than perhaps indirectly in the over-symbolism.</p>
