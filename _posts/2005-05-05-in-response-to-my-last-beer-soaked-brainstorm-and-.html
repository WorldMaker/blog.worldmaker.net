And under the influence of alcohol myself, I have to say that it's
reasons like this that I wish you'd done something more artsy.</div><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: gray;">[14:21]</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">&lt;Laura&gt;</span>
I mean, it sounds horribly cliche, but I think you have the soul of an
artist. Or whatever you want to call it. You need passion as much as
any of us do; that's what sets us apart, after all.</div><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: gray;">[14:21]</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">&lt;Laura&gt;</span>
You're good at what you do, and I'm not saying that you should stop
doing it. It's just that... I don't know. I can't think of a way to say
it that doesn't sound horrible and cliche.</div><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: gray;">[14:21]</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">&lt;Laura&gt;</span> So I'll just stop sending you myriad messages.</div>

<p>All of this really is interesting to me, because I've long debated it myself, and it is good to hear Laura try to articulate her own doubts.  I feel that even though I'm doing Engineering, and have had my ass handed to me on a silver platter by the mathematics, that there is still enough creativity in what I do that I can enjoy myself.  The entire reason I don't have a job this summer is because I realised I was no longer going to "settle" for a job that didn't offer me creative outlets...  if I can't find something even mildly creative (insofar as at least giving me design control, if not entirely a creative environment), then I'd rather not do anything.  UPS about killed me.  I felt oppressed and drowning in a sea of both futulity and mindless uncreativity.  The environment there was almost completely "anti-creative";  creating new things and coming up with novel new idas was blasphemy.  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" and all that bullshit.  The only reason I didn't go insane was that I wrote <a href="/fiction/metawar">Meta-War</a>, reread <i>The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul</i>, read the newspaper, and did the "Wonderword" and "Jumbles" in between those "fifteen minutes" of real work each day.</p>
