<div class="admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">May's 
Topic</p> <p>This month's round table 
discussion is on character flaws in 
games, or the lack thereof.</p>
<p>There a few <em>Secret of Monkey 
Island</em> spoilers, but none too 
shocking and certainly not the titular 
secret.  I manage to be primarily
spoiler free, but the same cannot be 
said about referenced Wikipedia
articles.</p>
</div>
<p>To be honest, I've been quite 
intrigued by posts so far in this round
table.  There's something of a early 
lament that so many characters in
gaming are of the nameless hero sort, 
immortal dimensionless shells, created 
as disguises for a player to crawl into 
and eke out fantasies of heroism that 
don't seem to involve any real 
character building (story-wise or 
otherwise, perhaps).  I think that 
there is a deep tie between a 
protagonist and the interface to a 
game, and a character's flaws are a 
meaningful part of that 
relationship.</p> <p>I'm an primarily 
an Old School Graphic Adventure fan and 
to me, most of my favorite characters 
to play have been anti-heroes and 
characters with flaws.  There's 
certainly a wealth of them, for me.  
There's <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larr
y_Laffer">Larry</a>,
whose attempts to get laid are so 
laughable and whose flaws redeem the
character from the precipice of 
insensitivity and bad soft porn.
There's <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roge
r_Wilco_%28Space_Quest%29">Roger 
Wilco</a>, space janitor and accidental 
saviour of the galaxy.  What about <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred
dy_Pharkas">Freddy Pharkas</a>, the 
gunslinger who retired to become a 
pharmacist?</p> 
<p>I've spent several replays with <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full
_Throttle_%281995_video_game%29">Ben</a
>, born rebel biker that can lead an
entire gang of fellow bikers but 
doesn't know how to deal with women.  I
particularly love the journey of <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim
_Fandango">Manuel Calavera</a>, as it 
echoes some of the journey of <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa
blanca_%28film%29">Rick Blaine</a> and 
invokes wild demons and balloon
animals in the process, and I wish <a 
href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php
/Residual">Residual</a> were further 
along.</p> <p>But there's one character 
whose flaws continually draw me to 
replays: the uniquely named <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyb
rush">Guybrush Threepwood</a>...</p>

<h2>You Look More Like a Flooring 
Inspector</h2> <p>It's hard to describe 
my relationship with Guybrush 
Threepwood.  He's somewhere between an 
incarnation of myself and brother that 
I've tormented.  Guybrush opens the 
<em>Monkey Island</em> series as a not 
too bright young man seeking fame and 
fortune as a notorious pirate, whose
only skill to his name was the ability 
to hold his breath for 10 minutes.  
Unlike Jim Hawkins he doesn't even have 
a very valuable treasure map to his 
name.  The only reason the local 
professional pirates even offer to 
teach Guybrush rudiments of pirating is 
because there's been a lot of recent 
attacks by a ghost-pirate, Captain
LeChuck, and pirates dumb enough to 
fight him are increasingly rare.</p>
<p>In <em>Secret of Monkey Island</em> 
Guybrush is a very likable sort of 
naïve kid with delusions of fame and 
fortune on the high seas.  Through a
mixture of pure determination and 
stupid luck, Guybrush even manages to
capture some small amount of fame 
towards the end of the game by 
eliminating one worldly avatar of the 
ghost-pirate Captain LeChuck.</p>
<p><em>Curse of Monkey Island</em>, the 
third game, throws a small reset switch
and once again leaves you with a more 
naïve Guybrush bumbling through
incredible odds to get the girl and 
defeat the bad guy.  <em>Curse</em> is 
a very loveable return to 
<em>Secret</em>'s formula.  <em>Escape 
from Monkey Island</em>, the fourth 
game, is ultimately something of a 
complete tangent to everything else and 
might be best described as "a lovely 
romp through scenic vistas of the 
Monkey Island series to socialize with 
its well known denizens".</p>

<p>Character development magic happens 
the most in <em>Monkey Island 2:
LeChuck's Revenge</em>.  This is the 
only numbered sequel and to some fans
the only true sequel in the series.  (I 
love <em>Curse</em>, so I think that it
belongs in the series, and 
<em>Escape</em> I remember being fun, 
if somewhat thematically disjoint, but 
I've yet to replay it since it first 
came out.  I do think there is good 
squeezing room between <em>MI2</em> and 
<em>Curse</em> for a true transitional 
game.)</p> <p>MI2 is the hardest of the 
first three for me to replay, because 
it's quite a bit darker than the 
others, and that's part of the 
intention. MI2 begins with Guybrush 
literally on the edge of a major 
screw-up.  A good bulk of the game is 
flashback to the screw-up.  The game's
flashback begins with Guybrush losing 
grasp of what little remained of
the coat-tails of his small fame from 
<em>Secret</em>, having estranged 
himself of his love interest, the 
Governess <a 
href="#119f808751720b58_id3">[1]</a> 
Elaine Marley, in the process of trying 
to remain in the addictive bliss of 
fleeting fame.  Having learned the 
fickleness of fame he decides to set 
out on the quest for that other 
piratical treat, treasure.  He makes 
finding the much talked about (and 
wonderfully named) treasure of <em>Big 
Whoop</em> his next task.</p> 
<p>Needless to repeat, things obviously 
don't go well for Guybrush through
the course of the game.  His ego 
remains mostly 3 sizes too big, thanks
to his brush with fame, and the 
combination of ego and some 
subconscious desire to be more 
piratical leads Guybrush to more malice 
than other games.  Guybrush certainly 
makes many of his most cutthroat 
actions over the course of MI2.</p>

<h2>That Doesn't Work</h2>
<p>In the world of Infocom adventures 
it is common enough to talk about
puzzle solving from the perspective of 
figuring out what the Implementor
expected versus what the goblin 
narrator, the ever present Parser <a 
href="#119f808751720b58_id4">[2]</a>,
expected.  A lot of this, I think, 
comes from the somewhat schizophrenic
nature of Infocom's original 
<em>Zork</em> series which began as one 
sprawling shared world where each 
original Implementor worked on 
different aspects of the game's design.  
Even in the era when Infocom 
Implementor's mostly worked on solo 
projects there was that habit of 
blaming odd or inconsistent puzzles on 
an Implementor rather than attributing 
them to consequences of the world or 
character design.</p> <p>In comparison 
I think that graphical adventure games 
are interesting because in many ways 
there is a greater attempt to push 
puzzle design directly into the world 
design.  I think this shows up 
primarily in the varying flaws of game 
protagonists in the graphical 
adventures of yore. A character's flaws 
become intertwined in the game's 
interface.  It's not "why didn't the 
Implementor think to let me use the 
credit card to open the door?" or "why 
didn't the Parser recognize that credit 
card fits the 'can jimmy doors' 
category?" there is much of a sense of 
"isn't it wild that Guybrush won't try 
jimmying that door with the credit card
and has to resort to using the 
screwdriver?"</p> <p>I think 
particularly interesting is the greater 
and greater push to the idea of the 
game being a puppeteer collaboration 
with the main character rather than 
illusions of direct control of his or 
her actions.  In a graphical adventure 
it is certainly more common for a 
character to share more of his or her 
inner monologue as things spoken out 
loud, presumably to himself, but 
obviously directly to the player.  
There's a good reason that the graphic 
adventure has been characterized by 
statements like "That doesn't work" and 
"I can't pick that up" and "That won't 
fit in my pocket"...</p>

<p>I think that MI2 is perhaps the best 
example of this collaboration with
the character.  With a slight change in 
the premise of Guybrush Threepwood's 
flaws, apropos to the narrative, from 
"earnest, yet bumbling fool" to 
"bearded man of ego", you see an almost 
entirely different feel to the overall 
game that certainly feels like it comes
from the main character's approach to 
the world at the time more than
the designer's specific thematic 
choice.  I think that it is great
design when character narrative 
reflects so much in the entire 
narrative.</p> <p>For me, MI2 is 
certainly one of the biggest and 
earliest chance encounters with some of 
the hard questions of who is 
controlling whom, something that seems 
to have become relatively popular in 
recent blockbuster narratives.  Am I, 
the player, Guybrush's conscience?  His
ego?  His unbelievable luck?  Do I 
encourage Guybrush to malice because
I demand it or because the puzzle 
design requires it?  Or is Guybrush
simply malicious and I'm only leading 
him in the right direction to direct 
his malice?</p> <p>In <em>GTA4</em> 
Niko Bellic's primary character flaw is 
a background of violence...  How much 
does the expression of violence in the 
game reflect Niko and how much reflects 
the inherent violence of the player
pulling the strings?  There is so much 
complaint about "the nature of the 
game" without nearly as much 
speculation and talk about the context
of the game with regard to the role of 
the player, much less the interplay of 
the character's background and the 
world he thrusts himself into.</p>
<p>I think there's a lot more places to 
discover interesting relationships
between players and a main character's 
flaws.  I think that there is certainly 
many more places to explore and I think 
there is some small movement recently 
in game design that starts to see that 
a game's interface is a refraction of a 
main character's flaws as much as a 
main character's abilities.  I look 
forward to exploring more worlds where
that matters...</p>
