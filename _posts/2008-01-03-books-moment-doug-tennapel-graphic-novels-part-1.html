<p>Just some quick mini-reviews, ordered by own my own weird reading order:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Gear</dt>
<dd>Just fun, weird steampunk with anthropomorphic cats and dogs.</dd>
<dt>Flink</dt>
<dd>Who doesn't want to believe that magic sasquatches roam the pacific northwest as hidden, photo-averse park rangers?  Cute-haters, that's who.  (Reminded me tangentially of the great <em>Futurama</em> episode involving the sasquatch.)</dd>
<dt>Tommysaurus Rex</dt>
<dd>Happy fairy tale: Boy loses dog.  Boy moves to farm.  Boy discovers T-Rex.  Boy eventually grows up.</dd>
<dt>Creature Tech</dt>
<dd>Doug has a weird neo-Gnosticism all his own and Creature Tech, so far, is the one that is the most there.  It's a funny sort of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> with space eels and mad magicians.  The gnostic elements simply add to the fantastical feel of the piece, and didn't bother me all that much.</dd>
<dt>Earthboy Jacobus</dt>
<dd>This a cute, fantastical &quot;triumph over evil&quot; voyage.  There were a few things that even really piqued my interest.  It's a veiled version of Jonah and the Whale and a not-so-veiled US Marines versus the &quot;commie&quot; hive-minded insects tale, but the art alone is worth it.</dd>
