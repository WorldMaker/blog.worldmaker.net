title: 'Book of the Moment: Strata'
---
I've basically exhausted the US published works of Terry Pratchett and so I've had a couple of his books imported at great cost of life by `a tribe of allied Amazonian aborigines that I've befriended via relatively frequent correspondences upon the vast world network of hydrodynamic tubing <http://www.amazon.com/>`_ from the United Kingdom...

*Strata* is one of PTerry's earliest forays into some of the areas that became embellished and expanded in his seminal, fantasy, Discworld series.  Only Strata's first voyage to the idea of a disc world was one from a science-fiction viewpoint.  As a Sci-Fi concept exploration it is easy to invoke the Ringworld series from Niven as a comparison.  It's a worthy comparison, but Ringworld is much more serious.  To me Strata reads very much like one of Asimov's more experimental, whimsical tales (sort of an *End of Eternity* meshed against one of his younger reader works or his humor pieces); bad puns, universe full of whimsy and mystery.  As a longtime fan of Asimov, it was quite refreshing.  (The only obvious real counter-point to the comparison here being Asimov's long hesitancy to use "alien races", which Strata makes some use of...)
