title: Too Many Words on The Fast & The Furious Franchise
tags: [fanwank, films]

I've been making my way through a rather quick marathon rewatch of *The Fast & The Furious* franchise.
Partly because these were guilty pleasures in college (and in a way described certain points in my
collegiate arc) and partly because supporting this franchise is a direct budgetary contribution to its
sibling franchise, Riddick (aka *Fast & Furious Space*), which I care more about. [I claim that Riddick
represents *Fast & Furious Space* both to point out that their budgets apparently are inseperable in the
last few iterations and also because it's something of a compliment to both franchises. The things both
franchises do well are ultimately shared between the two franchises, and ultimately so are many of the
faults in both.]

So the first three films of *The Fast & The Furious* describe a particular arc of my college experience.
The first film (*The Fast & The Furious*) was an important movie of my Freshman experience. The second film
(*Too Fast, Too Furious* or *2 Fast, 2 Furious*) as an interesting undergraduate step between sophmore and
junior efforts, and the third film (*Tokyo Drift* or *The Fast & The Furious Tokyo Drift*) was right on the
border between my undergraduate and graduate experiences.

To be honest, *Tokyo Drift* was where I gave up on the franchise, the first time around, and a large part of
why I'm curious to marathon the whole franchise and finally see what I missed since Part 3. *Tokyo Drift* felt
like the quintessential "straight-to-DVD" death of the franchise and I have a hard time seeing how the franchise
managed to make its way all the way to Seven entries. I'm curious to find out.

But I started the marathon with the three I already knew, and in doing so in a very fast weekend shotgun approach
I feel like it is somewhat obvious where at least some of the flaws lay. Essentially, films one and two have a
fairly straightforward three act structure. Let's call it: RACE!, Car build/Character build, and Heist. Both
films start with overly important races, lead into "car porn" car builds that happen to coincide with character
building (and some additional racing), with finally a heist set piece for finale. (The differences between the
first two films are primarily in the heist. The first film's heist is subversive in that the nominal goal of
the protagonist is to stop it and the implicit goal of the near-protoganists is to pull it off and yet neither
succeeds, whereas despite its twists the second film has a much more straightforward heist.)

The obvious problem with *Tokyo Drift*, in marathon shotgun retrospect, is that while it delivers a good Act 1 (RACE!),
with some subversions, and an okay Act 2 (Car build/Character build) with fewer subversions but somewhat more
interesting honesty, it ends there! It's missing it's third act, according to the formula established in the first
two films. Where's the HEIST? The worst part is you clearly get the sense that even the writers knew they were
missing it. The final scene (spoiler alert) brings in a much needed cameo of vin Diesel's Dom and this is clearly
the beginning of the Heist, but the movie ends there, as if on a cliffhanger that the writers clearly imagined
might be resolved in a *Tokyo Drift Part 2*... which doesn't end up happening. I'm very curious to see how four
through seven deal with *Tokyo Drift* and that's certainly a part of why I started this marathon in the first
place.

(Aside: one other formula break in *Tokyo Drift* that leaves it feeling lesser and inferior a product is the trend
of "featured rapper". Film one uses Ja Rule to interesting effect and film two uses Ludacris to an awesome effect (who
I am told returns in the series and whom has a great narrative role in the *Forza Horizon 2* spin-off).
Film three: Bow Wow's under inspiring performance as token black guy in Japan. He does well with the material he
has to work with, but that's not saying much, particularly about the material of the script...)

So yes, the biggest problem, I think, with *Tokyo Drift* is that it feels like the disconnected prequel to some better film
in the franchise. There's a lot of build up of (the annoying) Sean's character, but certainly not enough substance
and more importantly based from the efforts of the franchise's first two films no ultimate Heist and sort-of resolution.
Anyway, the marathon will continue as I watch parts four through seven for the first time, and maybe I'll have a
few too many words on that subject as I journey into the modern iterations of the franchise...
