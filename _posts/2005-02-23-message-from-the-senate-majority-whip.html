<blockquote title="Mitch McConnell">
On November 2, 2004, President George W. Bush won an <b>impressive</b> victory carrying 31 states and recieving 286 electoral votes.  Despite this <b>clear win</b> for the President, a <b>small minority</b> of partisans has raised concerns about the voting procedures in some states.
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.  There's more to laugh at in the rest of the form letter I received, but this was the major passage.  Apparently I should stop listening to the small minority of voices in my head and stop worrying about the accountability of the election process.</p>
