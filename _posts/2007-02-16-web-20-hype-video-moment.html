title: Web 2.0 Hype Video of the Moment
---
<p>Exhibit A: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE">The Web 2.0 Video Meme</a></p>
<p>Exhibit A is an Anthropologist's attempt (using some good video editing and music choice) to nail down what all the Web 2.0 Hype is about (and that we computer dorks all realize is merely a mainstream manifestation of good parts of ole Web &quot;1.0&quot; thinking).  It's cropped up on a number of the RSS feeds that I scroll and some interesting reactions have started to precipitate.</p>
<p>One of the things that stands out to me is the Anthropologist's seeming reach out of descriptivism and into prescriptivism with the &quot;Rethink&quot; sequence.  I haven't heard many remarks on that sequence, perhaps because it seem more hype(rbole) than substance to most, or because people subconsciously dismiss it as outside of the range of a mostly descriptive work.</p>
<p>I am not a sociologist, but I know people fascinated by them and the analysis of their number magics.  One of the interesting things, to me, is that studies (and I'm going to hand-wave here around the fact right now that I don't have any links off the top of my head) are starting to show a growing generation gap in thinking upon many of the things mentioned in the &quot;Rethink&quot; sequence.  For instance, the beliefs in Privacy between my generation and my parents' generation have become almost drastically different.</p>
<p>Where Privacy was often considered an almost tangible Right, my generation doesn't see it that way.  Privacy is more a matter of Respect and Trust; it isn't a Right to be defended but a Gift, a Kindness, a Boon to be granted and extended and offensively cordoned off with the weapons of Open-Mindedness and Toleration (and Otherness).</p>
<p>Two of the books I usually reference have been provided as Exhibits B and C in the Referenced Works sidebar...</p>
