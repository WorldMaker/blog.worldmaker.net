title: 'Book of the Moment: Vacation Reading'
---
<p>As is often usual, I got some good reading in during the vacation transit time.  Here are the books I touched this past "long" week.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>A Scanner Darkly</i> - Phillip K. Dick's psychodelic book of psychosis and drugs involving the twisted schizophrenic cop narcing on his own undercover drug-using identity.  I felt I had to read it as it is the next PKD work up for the Hollywood Chopping Block.  I'm not sure what to expect of Richard Linklater (screenplay/direction), but I am frightened of Keanu Reeves taking the emotion out of the main character's dual roles.  Charlie Kaufman wrote a screenplay that was not used for the film, and I'm guessing that I'm going to end up unfavorably comparing the film to Kaufman's screenplay.</li>
<li><i>The Man Who Folded Himself</i> - 
Great, quick read of a man and his travails in time, as he deals with meeting himself (over and over).  I'm always a sucker for a good time travel tale.</li>
<li><i>The End of Eternity</i> - 
Yet another time travel book, this one a classic from Master Asimov.  I've always loved reading Isaac Asimov's works.  The contrast of <i>End of Eternity</i> to <i>The Man Who Folded Himself</i> was striking and fun, one a light "diary" and the other a complexly plotted "crime novel".</li>
<li><i>Mortal Engines</i> - I finished only about half of this book, but will probably finish the other half relatively shortly.  Whereas Asimov and PKD are both "old friends" now, Lem is much more a new friend.  I was delighted by <i>The Cyberiad</i> and its whimsical tales of robot life.  <i>Mortal Engines</i> was also translated by Kandel, and I found myself nodding when Kandel spoke (in the introduction to <i>Mortal Engines</i>) of how much he enjoyed the "Baron Munchhausen Lem".  The first several tales of <i>Mortal Engines</i> are "robot fairy tales", and as with <i>The Cyberiad</i>, I love the poetry and finesse of the language.  It is amazing to think that the alliterations, rhythm, rhyme, (bad) puns, and quirky humor was translated from another language.  I can only admire both Lem and Kandel's hard work.  (I also find it intriguing that Lem and Asimov share both a love for humane robots and humorous word play.)</li>
