title: They Killed the Electric Car!  (Those Bastards!)
---
<p>For a limited time, Google Video has the documentary <a class="reference external" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5599073542041338932">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a> up.  Watch it.  If it goes down, rent it.  Watch it.  I think that with all of the material that I talk about, that has been ranted and raved about on even this blog, I could write an entire book titled <em>The Betrayal of the Consumer: The Invisible Hand's Extended Middle Finger</em>.  A group of rich men in the early 20th created a set a decisions, largely in collusion and with underhanded tactics, that transformed the entire landscape of the country, and today we are continuing to pay hand and foot to their descendents, their cronies, their un-american alliances...</p>
