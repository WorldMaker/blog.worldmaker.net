title: 'Skip Generation: Xbox One the Console of Almost'
---
<p>Since I've owned video game consoles, every other generation for me has
been a <em>skip generation</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a>. So it comes again, and it is once again a
skip generation and the consoles have a lot to prove to me if they want
me to buy one. Given how long the 360 lasted, I'm a bit concerned that
this possibly may be effectively my retirement generation from consoles,
but there's always the PC. (And maybe it'll only be a half-skip,
depending on course corrections, or maybe the Wii U will finally drill
directly into the nostalgia center of my heart.)</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 won me over with two key pieces, both expressable as
acronyms: XBLA and XNA. Subsequently there were two big things I was
waiting to hear about with the Xbox One announcements: backwards
compatibility and developer support. Sadly it seems that we get neither,
and I am left disappointed with how the Xbox One might have been
<strong>almost</strong> the console for me.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-drm-issue">
<h1>The DRM Issue</h1>
<p>Of course, I first have to provide my opinion about the elephant in the
room and that is the strange, &quot;new&quot; DRM of the Xbox One. I'm not
<em>against</em> the Xbox One DRM on principle. I've been a digital download
proponent for some time, and it is very easy to admit that the Xbox One
DRM <em>isn't</em> the worst digital download DRM scheme out there. Sure, it's
a tiny bit strange that it also applies to physical discs, but I can
give that the benefit of the doubt. (Again given that digital download
is pretty much my default at this point, and I've never been much of one
to trade back games or to buy used ones. Admittedly I've been rather
privileged in those departments.)</p>
<p>But, I <strong>needed</strong> just one thing to sell me on the new DRM, and that
was <em>backwards compatibility</em>. I was an early adopter of Steam and for
the most part my library has survived almost a decade. I downloaded
patches for my copy of Half-Life 1 over dial-up via Steam, and today I
can still redownload those Half-Life 1 installs via Steam and play them.</p>
<p>It's a hard sell, for me at least, to accept the new DRM knowing that my
large collection of XBLA games cannot come for the ride. Sure, there are
some technical limitations and legal limitations that might restrict
the number of games that might come across, but so far word is &quot;none&quot;,
and after my existing DRM complaints <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a>, I'm not particularly
confident that Xbox One purchases might survive to the Xbox One + 1.</p>
<p>The Xbox One DRM actually makes some interesting promises. In
particular, what plays to the way I want to share games, is the promise
that nearly every game should be available at my fingertips when I visit
a friend's place and use their machine. That's a lovely concept, and a
great way to make use of the coop games that I love to buy and that play
best in &quot;couch&quot; cooperative modes, when I can play those both on my own
couch or on a friends' couch.</p>
<p>But it's still too bad that I can't use my existing library to kickstart
that. Who amongst my friends hasn't wished that they couldn't merge
everyone in the room's DLC for Rock Band night? I'd love to use Castle
Crashers or Borderlands, or any of the other games I already owned but
haven't played enough of yet. Even just the XNA-based games <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[3]</a> like
Schizoid or Bastion would wonderfully to have.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="developers-developers-developers">
<h1>Developers, Developers, Developers</h1>
<p>It's still possible that an announcement could be made in this general
direction, but given the various sorts of response thus far about
independent developers thus far I'm not holding out anymore hope.</p>
<p>Where's the love for managed developers? Why was XNA so cold-heartedly
murdered?</p>
<p>Where's the love for Windows 8 apps? Sure, Kinect and Controller may not
work for every Windows 8 app, but a good number of them may work out of
the box. With SmartGlass there could be an interesting ability to throw
Windows Store apps to/from the Xbox One and Windows 8 tablets. That
would be compelling.</p>
<p>Microsoft is the best theoretical position to make use of developers and
yet with Xbox One not only does it seem thus far that they are not
capitalizing on that position, but they are actually knowingly (and
sadly) back-pedaling and locking down and building walls where they
weren't needed.</p>
<p>Honestly, support for XNA developers, even if they had to resubmit and
sign new contracts, would have gone a long way to make the Xbox One
much, much more interesting. Mr. Ballmer, tear down these walls.</p>
