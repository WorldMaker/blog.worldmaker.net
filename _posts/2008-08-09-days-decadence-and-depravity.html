title: Days of Decadence and Depravity
---
<p>It began, earnestly enough, over a course of thick vegetable soup.  It
was loaded with vegetables, time-shifted into this early May lunch
through diligent, or at least dreary, work from cross-national food
conglomerates, and chunks of a well-cooked slow roasted chuck roast.
Between greedy mouthfuls and long sips of sweetened iced tea he
alternated story telling and dips of dripping grilled American cheese
sandwich.  He talked of how much it reminded him of his grandmother's
version of the vegetable soup, only that it needed fresh okra and good
Kentucky lima beans so big that they qualified as steaks in some
countries, and so juicy that eating one was its own mini-bowl of soup.</p>
<p>The place was packed and at a general level even more excited than he
was.  It was a pharmacist's lunch counter, grade A Americana, spelled
with a capital Kitsch, and filled with a couple of college students and
a huge gathering of &quot;horse people&quot;; jockeys and trainers and contingent
staff.  People that were making huge bonuses this week, compared to
their generally meager blue collar lot in life, but they did it for love
and they did it for fame and they particularly did it for <em>Derby</em>.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the couple, even amongst his stories of nearly blue
collar grandparents and actual blue collar relatives, could be seen as
disparate objects in this place.  He suggested it, a known haunt from
his own college days, because it was &quot;quaint&quot; and &quot;real&quot; and miles away
from celebrit√©, even as it stood under the shadows of that weeks' most
important place.  She wasn't well enough known that the blue collar
crowds would recognize her outside of her act, and she was happy to
accompany him, to have a native guide on this small vacation in early
May.</p>
<p>She interrupted his rambling to point out that she had only a passing
knowledge of okra.  He finished drinking the tomato broth remaining in
his bowl, stared at her for a few minutes, lost in thought, and then
stood up, pulling on his light jacket, proceeding round the table to help
her do so.  He walked with her to the pharmaceutical counter to pay for
what she took to be an astoundingly cheap meal.  He asked for a 750 of
Woodford Reserve, which was both a good bourbon on prominent display
behind the counter and a shared luxury amongst the classes.  He inquired
as to a flask, having none on him, and acquired one to add to his tab.</p>
<p>He stashed the bourbon in their rental car, but not before pouring some
into his flask and stashing the flask in a pocket, and with that he
invited her to walk with him a few blocks.  She hesitated for a few
moments, not too inclined to walk in her heels, but with his insistence
and the plain beauty of a sun-drenched afternoon she relented.  Almost
immediately she nearly slipped upon the gravel in the few feet between
the car and the sidewalk, but he was a perfect gentleman, both keeping
her upright and simultaneously feigning ignorance of her stumble.</p>
<p>The walk was nearly a block too long for her, she huffed.  The walk
having been a nearly depressing one as they passed a mixture of churches
and nice houses betwixt awful rotting ones and dubious businesses, the
sun brightly illuminating both unkempt and well loved buildings equally.
Nestled just before an ugly train aqueduct and just across from an
abandoned and equally graffiti-ed gas station was a blue and white
colored fried fish restaurant that filled the air with the smells of
fried temptation.  He joked about nearly leading her to the better,
hole-in-the-wall fish place five or six blocks further north.</p>
<p>The counter was staffed by a couple of low income high school aged kids,
but they were relatively quick with the simple order of fried mushrooms
and fried okra.  He requested a container of the restaurant's carefully
hoarded cocktail sauce and they sat down at a boring, and to her
startlingly clean, fast-food booth.  He had ordered another sweetened
iced tea, and to this one he added a splash of bourbon from his flask.
Her curiosity got the best of her and she took a small sip of now
alcoholic tea.  At which point he introduced her to the wonder of fried
okra.  He warned her about the hot bursts of water contained in the
fried foods after nearly burning his mouth in his impatience to eat one
of the fried mushrooms he had entirely coated in cocktail sauce.  At
first bite of the okra she was a little unimpressed, but he coaxed her
to notice the sweet undertones of the vegetable versus its tangy
exterior and the fish-tasting fried batter.</p>
<p>Once they had finished she let him know on few uncertain terms that she
was not prepared to walk the full length to the car.  He assuaged her
worries and suggested using the bus.  He lead her out of the fish
restaurant and west into the afternoon sun.  As they walked the single
block to the nearest major bus stop he further suggested they take it in
the opposite direction of her rental car to spend a few hours at a good
pub.  She look at the slender gold watch around her wrist, shrugged, and
then agreed.  Already waiting at the bus stop was a low income man
heading to some afternoon job blocks away from his home and a homeless
man getting ready for his own late shift haranguing the club-hopping
rich for spare change.</p>
<p>The stop was in front of a chain drugstore, contrasting with lunch's
mom and pop shop.  Across the street they had just followed from the
fish place was a dingy looking chain discount shoe retailer.  A gas
station anchored the diametric corner and he pointed out the pizzeria
beside it as a great place to get Chicago-style deep dish.  Houses in
various states of repair and negligence filled up much of the rest of
the view as they waited, just as they had seen on the rest of their
walk.</p>
<p>The bus ride was a rather uneventful journey over a dozen blocks north.
He pointed out a local coffee shop and Central Park and the main library
branch brushed past just prior to their arrival at the stop he warned
her they were getting off at, Broadway.  She watched in fascination as
nearly all of the people on the bus lined up to exit at that
intersection with nearly half that many people waiting patiently to get
onto the bus.</p>
<p>The pub, a local micro-brewery, was just across Broadway and past a
large business building across from a major hotel tower.  They sidled up
to an outer bar and he ordered a beer, receiving it in a larger mug
reserved for the bar's patrons.  She wondered at his barfly nature given
that this mug was chosen based solely on recognition of him by the
bartender.  He encouraged her to try a Mint Julep and she found herself
intrigued enough to try one.   She found the mix of fresh mint and
bourbon too heady and strong and he suggested she temper it with a
little bit of club soda.</p>
<p>He informed her that some considered the sparkly club soda verboten in a
&quot;real&quot; mint julep, but in his own well regarded opinion just enough club
soda to suit an individual's taste was perfectly warranted.  The club
soda-infused Mint Julep would prove to be her undoing that afternoon.</p>
<p>A few older ladies staying at the hotel across the street had wound up
at the bar near to the couple and it was shortly after that when the
ladies recognized her and begged her autograph.  Hearing the commotion
the manager on duty happily comped the couple's next round and before
long the afternoon had passed over the course of several more rounds and
evening proceeded much the same with brief intermissions for bites of
pub food.  A small crowd of onlookers, fans, and soon to be fans
gathered around the couple, hanging on to every word and laughing at the
opportune moments in the conversation.  Every now and then word would be
passed that some larger star had been spotted further north unto the
depths of crass commercial clubs and sections of the hovering crowd
would break away to follow those rumors, only to be replenished by
newcomers.</p>
<p>Following pressure from the surrounding crowd the couple even relented
to join in a few pub games, including the  suggestively named
&quot;cornhole&quot;; the couple displayed an admirable mixture of lack of skill
and loss of skill due to increasing alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>The temporal and spatial disparity between the pub and the delivery of
breakfast at precisely half past ten the following morning, as
requested, led the couple to speculate on which one had driven the
distance to the hotel drunk.  In addition, a morning Mimosa and
breakfast Bloody Mary had been thoughtfully provided by the hotel, and
that led only to further suspicions of how drunk they must have been
upon arrival.  Neither had much remorse for having driven drunk for the
rest they had received, but were particularly remorseless given the
wonderful outlook for the coming day provided by waking up to eggs and
champagne.</p>
<p>It should be noted that drunk driving is not to be condoned in any
manner and that conveyance had been obtained via the wise counsel of the
microbrewery that involved a combination of taxi cab and scooter-based
designated driver service, both of which were handsomely paid in tips
for their services.</p>
<p>Upon the slow activation of communication devices her publicist finally
managed to get a hold of her and insure that she was well versed in the
days activities.  The publicist also managed to drop the word that her
concerted effort in schmoozing the management at Churchill Downs had
finally paid off into throwing in Millionaire's Row access on top of
their already acquired last minute seats at the track.  The publicist
let them know to expect the passes to be left by courier at the hotel's
front desk sometime prior to them setting out the next day.</p>
<p>A taxi had been requisitioned by the publicist, under the publicist's
budget of funds, to get the already inebriated couple to the days
activities upon the Bardstown Road area.  They ate a wild smattering of
worldly appetizers at a local caf√© for a simple late lunch.  At his
behest they then walked the block to a well-regarded local bookstore.
Having been well introduced to his pedestrianating ways the day before
she had wisely worn flats and refused to complain any further about his
wandering.</p>
<p>At the bookshop he stumbled into a relative, whom he introduced to her
and by whom he was introduced to the store's owner.  That lead to
discussions of his humble published work, which the owner had stocked a
surprising number of as something of a local curio.  A few customers
leaked into the discussion and soon he found himself roped into an
impromptu signing session as the bookstore sold several new copies.  The
adjoining local coffee shop offered free caffeinated beverages to the
couple.</p>
<p>Following the impromptu signing event they managed to be a few minutes
late to her scheduled appearance at the local music store several blocks
south.  Her publicist had done her job admirably and there was precious
delay between her timely, albeit late, arrival and her short solo
acoustic set.  A few of the pub-goers from the night before had
wonderfully thickened the crowded reception.  Stacks of her group's
recent album seemed to disappear.</p>
<p>A few in the crowd may have noticed the looks the couple shared as she
sung.  She sung with great emotion and given the ear and the heart for
it, perhaps there were those that caught the undertones of the real
emotions, the raw chemistry at work upon her vocal chords.  Even those
that did catch fragments of that emotional core to her work that
afternoon would not catch as well as he did that most of the words she
sung that day were his.  She had kept the set list from him, and his
smile was all she needed in reception to her choice.  It was something
of a gift to him, for him and his hometown and a small but attentive
audience in a small, intimate venue.  It was just the right sort of set
for such an audience.  The few that recognized her would not be the sort
of fans to clamour for her to cover more of her group's more
recognizable songs.  It was enough that she fill the space with her
music and her emotion.</p>
<p>An employee that helped her set up approached him and gently tapped his
shoulder.  This employee introduced him to an unusual but well regarded
guest to the store standing discreetly out of the crowd, someone that
would have been recognized if it weren't for the rapt attention the
audience paid to the singer before them.  This guest, a wealthy twin of
some local renown, shook his hand and chatted with him between breaks
between songs.  This twin noticed at least some of how he reacted to
each new song and dared not disturb such a beautiful rapport.  But
slowly the twin spun from him enough of the couple's story to satisfy
curiosity.  With that as her token, this twin, wove for him an invite to
the party she co-hosts, a charitable ball of worldly wonder and a vast
cross-roads of celebrity, where she should have been embroiled in last
minute planning rather than visiting a small musical set nearby.  The
twin insisted upon conveying them from their hotel at the right hour via
an available limo service.  Somewhat flustered he did his best to
politely accept the invitation and then asked his leave to place more
attention on the closing songs of her set.</p>
<p>Immediately as the publicity agent's workers set to their arrangements
to get what equipment needed to travel to its next destinations he
pulled her out from the fracas and enveloped her in a warm embrace, a
tender kiss, a whispered nothing.  She looked into his eyes and saw his
wonder and inquired as to what had happened.  He explained the party
invitation, and then he explained the party's significance, and then he
explained the need to hurry back to the hotel to change.</p>
<p>On the taxi ride back to the hotel she reminded him to call his mother
and postpone their earlier dinner plans.  His mother wasn't exactly
ecstatic, but she was poor at hiding her lack of disappointment.  He
assumed that some small neighborly work may have gone into that
invitation.  Louisville can be small town for such a large city and
he couldn't shake the impression that what was made to appear an
invitation upon a belated lark had in fact been an orchestrated plot by
his friends and family.  But he couldn't press his mother on the
subject.  He knew well enough that she would tell him in her own way
sometime later, and he didn't really care to know definitively.</p>
<p>What followed included the general haze of a rush to change clothes
while simultaneously attempting some small decompression and take a
quick breather in the middle of a hectic day.  The limo arrived in time
and the couple was generally resplendent in attire, as they were
expected to be.</p>
<p>The party followed in a somewhat relaxed manner, a night of warm toasts
and good wine and a handful of diverse conversations and a million
introductions, including many celebrities and individuals of much
&quot;higher status&quot; than the couple.  She was gently coaxed into joining in
several impromptu and wild jam sessions, including a few with her
musical idols.  She pressured him into joining into a gentle duet on one
of the songs he had written for her.</p>
<p>They drank like fish and spoke of charity and celebrity.  They danced
in the hall and under the stars and with each other and without.  The
couple laughed there way through the evening and into the limo appointed
to convey them back to the hotel and into to bed, regaling each other
with stories of the night before dozing off.</p>
<p>In the morning he drove their rental car to the track, having a few
ideas of where to find cheaper parking.  He lead her to the track and
she marveled at how different the area seemed from only a few days
prior.  She barely recognized the pharmacy as they passed it, so she
verified it with him.</p>
<p>Just about every lot was packed, even as early as their ten
o'clock arrival, and local residents hawked precious lawn space as
parking lot space.  Police maneuvered walls of pedestrians and walls of
cars around each other.  Street vendors further cluttered some of the
streets, promoting memorabilia and foods of dubious value, just as
street vendors attempt to ween cash from tourist throngs everywhere.</p>
<p>They watched a few races and visited Millionaire's Row with the pass her
publicist had procured for them.  They had gotten over their shock of
rubbing elbows with bigger celebrities in the drunken camaraderie of the
previous night's party, but they made small talk and posed for a few
photos and were pressured into making a few bets.  They contemplated
wandering back to their other seats, but stayed for the amazing food,
most made with local ingredients by a talented and enthusiastic
five-star chef.  She drank club soda-tempered and he stayed relatively
sober sticking to a few glasses of expensive wine.  They lost just about
all the money they bet on the horses, but they whooped and hollered with
everyone else during the races...</p>
<div class="admonition-the-kentucky-derby-is-decadent-and-depraved admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">The Kentucky Derby <em>is</em> Decadent and Depraved</p>
<p>Hunter S. Thompson, is of course, entirely correct, the Kentucky
Derby is decadent and depraved, but there is a certain majesty to it,
nonetheless.  Being a native to Louisville I have a much different
view of the sporting event than non-natives.  Most obviously, I know
what so much of the area looks like during a more normal week, and
thus the story germinated just about where the story begins:</p>
<p>I was eating lunch in the mentioned fish place on a dirty
intersection both a few blocks from Churchill Downs and a few blocks
from campus.  It was finals week <strong>and</strong> Derby Week, a University of
Louisville experience probably hard to match.  (An amazing
intersection of hectic class schedules, crazy events to partake in,
and then the normal Spring finals celebration running headlong into
wild Derby partying.)  I was listening to a few low-ish class diners
complain about ordinary struggles and thinking about Derby tradition
and royalty and how I was merely days away from the huge crowds that
would be centered on the track only blocks away...</p>
<p>I meant to finish this story <em>by</em> Derby Day, but obviously that plan
fell by the wayside in all the other activities that happened.  The
story is better for it as I think I plugged some obvious gaps it had
needed.  Maybe next Derby I'll think about posting an annotated
&quot;Special Edition&quot; to explain some of the in-jokes and provide a map
of some the places visited in this tale...</p>
<p class="last">Interestingly this story is a lot longer than I intended, which is
neat because I used to have such a hard time inflating short stories.</p>
