<p>I deal with a lot of spam everyday.  I have a finely tuned &quot;spam sense&quot; that works somewhat like Spider-Man's spidey sense, only much less useful in heroic situations.  (&quot;Duck!  Here comes another c1al1s advert...&quot;)  A corporate website of any form is an attempt to have a conversation with me.  If you trigger that spam sense, you seriously damage my opinion of the conversation.  Here's two big pointers that should have been learned 5 years ago, but may need to be refreshed from time to time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Always, always, always make any email distribution lists opt-in.  In an application process, auto-checking an opt-in &quot;on my behalf&quot; is the exact same as an opt-out,, it is no longer an opt-in because if I ignore it or miss it I suddenly get unsolicited mail.  Repeat after me: a preselected opt-in is no longer an opt-in, no matter how friendly the language next to the checkbox, it is an opt-out.  My time is valuable to me...  I will either spend the time to read and ponder your distribution <em>or</em> I will uncheck the box.  I will not do both if you trigger that spam sense when skimming.</li>
<li>Once I make a selection or choice: don't question the selection or choice and certainly don't try to do one last upsell to some &quot;better&quot; choice.  The more upsells, the more it feels like you are trying to spam me to death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, both of those points should be obvious, and are very easy to keep in mind.  If your company violates them, your marketers and/or web staff (and I know which one I typically bet on being in charge of these decisions) have some 'splainin' to do as to why they hate your customers.</p>
