title: The Ballmer Peak
---

<p>I've mentioned this before because I've experienced it personally and seen it in others, but <a class="reference external" href="http://xkcd.com/323/">this comic on the Ballmer Peak</a> is the first attempt I've seen to name it.  I do have extraordinary moments of programming clarity in that weird twilight between &quot;buzzed&quot; and &quot;drunk&quot;.  It's also the only point where I have any sort of Geometry Wars skills at all (all of my achievements in the game having arrived when I was drunk).</p>
