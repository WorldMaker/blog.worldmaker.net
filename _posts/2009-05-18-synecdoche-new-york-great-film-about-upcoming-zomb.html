title: 'Synecdoche, New York: A Great Film About the Upcoming Zombie Apocalypse?'
---
<p>I've got post ideas for some of the deeper themes of <em>Synecdoche, NY</em>,
but figured it might be more fun to open debate on one of the possibly
sillier themes. Synecdoche is obviously a movie about the &quot;small
horrors&quot;, the horrors that occur to a person naturally through the
course of decay. Decay is an obvious, deep theme of the movie.  The film
was always meant to be that sort of a horror film, as from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38895">this
Synecdoche interview at AICN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
...what happened was that Spike [Jonze] and I originally were
approached by Sony to do... to do a horror movie, and we talked about
ideas and we wanted to do something that sort of wasn't attached to
the genre notion of horror, and so we were talking about things that
are scary in the real world, and in our lives...</blockquote>
<p>I think that perhaps the truly amazing part of Synecdoche is that it
also merits the debate over whether or not the movie also contains large
horrors. The movie wraps us up in all of the small horrors, but then
leaves enough ambiguity if you start to wonder about what is happening
at a larger level that there is certainly room for interpretation. I
shall provide one interpretation, what I consider a &quot;silly&quot;
interpretation and I certainly have very little idea about its overall
validity, but it is a fascinating angle of the film to talk about: I
think that Synecdoche is &quot;secretly&quot; a movie about a Zombie Apocalypse,
and if it is, well then I think it may truly be a hallmark film for
Zombie Apocalypse films.</p>
<p>First of all, I think its important to start from the realization that
the point of view of the film is largely Caden's, and even when Caden is
not directly involved in a scene (and I know of only one important scene
where that is the case), his (and his second's) shadow looms large over
the picture. I very much feel that Synecdoche is just about the closest
film I've seen get to a first person novel's perspective, and much more
importantly: an unreliable first person narrative. Secondly, and related
to the concept of an unreliable first person narrative: Charlie Kaufman
continues to suggest that the more surreal elements of the film should
be examined as serious or true to the film's reality (albeit, perhaps
only to Caden himself) rather than deeply metaphorical or even
facetious.</p>
<p>I posit in this theory of mine, that much of the more fantastical
elements of the film may be examined as coping mechanisms of Caden's
mind upon trying to parse larger and deeper horrors. There is a running
'virus' thread through the film (&quot;infectious diseases in cattle&quot;), and
it is my impression that the deep horror ravaging New York City through
at least the second half of the film is a Zombie outbreak, filtered
through Caden's tunnel vision of the world at large.</p>
<p>If that is indeed the case, I cannot think of any other film that so
dramatically skews the perception of both the audience and the
protagonist that we get within throwing distance of real psychological
breakdown from real humor. Imagine if <em>I Am Legend</em> had Will Smith's
mannequin externalizations actually talking back to him, if his spiral
to deeper insanity left the audience questioning their own experiences
of the events. I've got a feeling that <em>Synecdoche</em> is currently the
closest film to just that.</p>
<p>Here's a possible timeline (possible <strong>spoilers</strong>, watch the movie first
for the second time, if you haven't already) that I've concocted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Early into Caden's warehouse project an outbreak of a &quot;flesh eating
virus&quot; throws New York City into panic. New York's large low-to-middle
'actorly' class, the many in New York City with any sort of acting
talent at all, seek refuge in Caden's warehouse. As long as they put
up with Caden's stage direction they could live full time in the
warehouse in a simulacrum of New York as it was just before all hell
started to break loose.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Eventually the government catches up to the crisis. The poor and
untalented, but otherwise uninfected, that couldn't pass Caden's
not-very-rigorous auditions get corralled up by, seemingly, government
vehicles and sent to a quarantine camp, euphemistically called
'Funland'.</p>
<p>Here we hear pleas of &quot;When will it open?&quot; and we filter it through
Caden's ego and assume that these people are desperate to get in,
because they are desperate to see great art. Or we filter it through
Caden's self-doubt and assume they are mocking Caden's ambitions. The
masterstroke is that in the objective reality they may in fact simply
be (pun intended) <em>dying</em> to get in.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Near the worst, Caden follows Hazel back out into the real New York.
By this point New York is a war torn shell of what it once was.
Caden's memory happily fills in Hazel's neighborhood as a timeless
version, but his mind can't escape at least some of the effects of
time upon his obsessions: Hazel and her house. It's possible that the
earlier manifestations of the house under fire are merely
psuedo-memories backward extrapolated to provide sense to a brutal
truth of the destroyed and decaying present.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Under the control of Caden's female replacement the warehouse becomes
more serious and less of the silly fun of Caden's ever-present bathos
('b' intended). It's possible that she, Caden's anima, seeks to fast
forward the simulation to the devastation of New York. There are
'Freedom Riots' and the actors rebel against their direction. Perhaps
some actors escape, and many die. Caden himself is too exhausted, too
deep in his own thoughts, to let the final horrors sink in. The final
horrors of so many dead actors slip past what remain of Caden's
filters, but it is too late for them to have as much of an impact as
they should.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly those are the important keys to the Zombie theory, and other
dangling ideas (perhaps Olive's disease is related to the Zombie Virus,
perhaps the psychiatrist was experiencing an early variant, perhaps even
some of Caden's own decay is related in some fashion). Certainly the
film is ambiguous enough that this is just one interpretation of events.</p>
<p>It's also, perhaps, tenuous that the disaster afflicting New York is in
fact Zombies or a Zombie-like plague. I can only offer the brief fly by
of 'flesh eating virus' as reason enough to prefer a Zombie
interpretation over other similar apocalyptic occurrences. With the
recent popularity of Zombie films, I think that whether or not the
'large horror' of the film is a Zombie Apocalypse the film offers a
particularly strong comparison to recent Zombie films.</p>
<p>I'm curious if anyone else finds the Zombie Theory interesting.</p>
