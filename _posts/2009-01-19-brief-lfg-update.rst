I'm scheduled to interview with Microsoft in Redmond next Monday for a full-time position...  I'm under the impression that it's unlikely I will be interviewing with or end up working with a position in E&D (Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices division and the home of Microsoft's Games, where I have a certain interest in working).  But any position in Microsoft should be nice and even if I don't start in E&D I can certainly try to move laterally towards that if I do end up somewhere else in the company...

Anyway, so I've got this lovely mixture of trepidation and happiness [1]_ and some paper work left to do...
