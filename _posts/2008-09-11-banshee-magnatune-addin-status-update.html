title: Banshee Magnatune Addin Status Update
---
<p>I've had a few people talking about my <a class="reference external" href="http://magnatune.code.worldmaker.net/">Magnatune for Banshee</a> addin recently, which is awesome so I figured I should make a definitive post of its current status.  First off, the good news: according to Banshee's bugzilla the next release should add support for the authenticated streams that the addin tries when given a Magnatune membership username and password, so no more ads for members looking for one click genre radio play.  (I say should because I'm just using the Ubuntu PPA and haven't tried a recent SVN build.)</p>
<p>The sad addin news (but fun, stressful personal news): Last semester of Graduate school!  The Magnatune addin I wrote was a quick weekend hack that was an attempt to explore MonoDevelop and Mono.Addins and Banshee (and a little bit of Gtk#).  I don't have any time to work on the much requested (especially by myself) full catalog browser, even though I wish I did.  I would certainly accept patches and would be happy to maintain the add-in, but unless I see a free weekend and a magic burst of productivity where I think my graduate work and a few other projects are in good shape, I don't expect any progress on my addin in the near future...  It's on the back burner, but not forgotten.  Right now I'm trying to make sure that I get that degree in my hands come December...</p>
