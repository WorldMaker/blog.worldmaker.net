title: The Mac v. PC Ads
---
<p>I think that the latest Mac v. PC ads are hilarious, mostly because I think they are pedantic and condescending to <i>everyone</i> on both sides of the "divide".  I think the sole winning factor is that it is John Hodgeman, who is great in every television appearance (loving him on The Daily Show), as the poor PC.  I don't think they realize it, but it is much easier to empathize with, and thus care for, the simple, dry irony of the PC character.  <a href="http://www.technewsology.com/macvspc.html">This page says about the same thing.</a>  I almost feel like buying a new PC...</p>
