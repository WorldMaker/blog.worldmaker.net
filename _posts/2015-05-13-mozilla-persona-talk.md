title: "Login is Terrible: Web Login the Simple Way, or Mozilla Persona Can Save Us (If We Save It)"
---

Tonight I gave a talk at the [Kentucky Open Source Software meetup](http://kyoss.org)
on [Mozilla Persona](http://persona.org) as the login system that could save the web, if we can manage
to help it get adopted in more places. It's a safer, more private, easy to use
alternative to the mess of technologies and disconnected password databases we
currently use. The concept was to demonstrate Persona login into an actual real world
website, in this case the [StingerCheck](http://stingercheck.azurewebsites.net) app
I wrote and also show how simple the integration code is for that website
([StingerCheck on GitHub](http://github.com/WorldMaker/StingerCheck/)).

I thought it was a good idea to give this talk precisely because of the concept of
"Community Ownership" of Mozilla Persona and the idea that we as a community own it
and Mozilla Persona isn't going anywhere unless we present it to various parts of our
communities and passionately explain why we need it and why it's the right solution
that more website developers should consider and more website users should maybe ask for.

There wasn't available wifi I could connect to in the conference room, so I was glad I
had prepared screenshot backup slides of the login demonstaion at the end of the slide
deck. Hopefully they were almost as useful as actually seeing it live.

Here's the slide deck I built for the talk:
