title: Brief LFG Update

<p>I'm scheduled to interview with Microsoft in Redmond next Monday for a full-time position...  I'm under the impression that it's unlikely I will be interviewing with or end up working with a position in E&amp;D (Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices division and the home of Microsoft's Games, where I have a certain interest in working).  But any position in Microsoft should be nice and even if I don't start in E&amp;D I can certainly try to move laterally towards that if I do end up somewhere else in the company...</p>
<p>Anyway, so I've got this lovely mixture of trepidation and happiness <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> and some paper work left to do...</p>
