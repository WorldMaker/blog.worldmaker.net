title: Second draft of The Business of Liberty
---
<p>I've posted the second (and final required) draft of <a href="/cecs311/liberty">The Business of Liberty</a>.  One of the coolest things for me was that I recieved a correction (which has now been incorporated) from one of the people mentioned in the paper.  The teachers wanted this draft to be shorter than the first, but I'm a long winded guy and realized that was not possible for me.  This second draft is just slightly longer than the first (the average of the changes resulted in it being about a paragraph longer than the first).</p>
