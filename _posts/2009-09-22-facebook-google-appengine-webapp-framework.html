title: Facebook on Google AppEngine "webapp" Framework
---
<p>I've got a small backlog of code that I've been meaning to open source
and &quot;announce&quot; so this week may very well be &quot;coding&quot; week here on my
blog. I promise to try to mix things up and get my Round Table post
written this week (not that I have many days after this week to do so)
as well.</p>
<p>The first couple, at least, will be remotely <em>Assassins!</em>-related.
Because right now the codebase is the most valuable asset in my poor,
poor company I don't plan to open source the majority of the code
itself. I do plan to re-release the last version of Assassins, which now
is merely a distant relative to the &quot;modern&quot; codebase. This week my plan
is to release some of the sub-projects that Assassins has yielded.</p>
<p>Today's choice bit is <tt class="docutils literal">webappfb.py</tt>, which is a relative to
the <tt class="docutils literal">djangofb</tt> toolset that <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfacebook.googlecode.com">Pyfacebook</a> provides for Facebook
applications targeting Django. In this case it is many similar tools for
Google App Engine's bare bones object-oriented <tt class="docutils literal">webapp</tt> framework. I
know that <tt class="docutils literal">webapp</tt> isn't the greatest framework, nor is it one with a
great amount of support. However, it is a great minimal framework that
seems perfect for the super-fast response times that are needed for a
Facebook application. <tt class="docutils literal">webappfb.py</tt> is a similarly &quot;minimal&quot; toolkit
to remove some of the repetition needed in developing Facebook apps
against <tt class="docutils literal">webapp</tt>.</p>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of git, but it's what &quot;upstream&quot;, <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfacebook.googlecode.com">Pyfacebook</a>, has
swapped to, so it's what I've used in this case. I've posted
<tt class="docutils literal">webappfb.py</tt> to my fork at github: <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/WorldMaker/pyfacebook/blob/master/facebook/webappfb.py">webappfb.py</a>. I also did the
kind thing and sent a pull request upstream to see if it sticks.</p>
<p>I'll have to write &quot;real&quot; documentation, probably, but it should be
mostly self-explanatory to anyone that has seen <tt class="docutils literal">webapp</tt>
documentation. Primarily, <tt class="docutils literal">webappfb.FacebookRequestHandler</tt> can be
used just about anywhere you would use <tt class="docutils literal">webapp.RequestHandler</tt>.
<tt class="docutils literal">FacebookRequestHandler</tt> provides a <tt class="docutils literal">self.facebook</tt> instance (using
the API key and secret key that you can store in a simple
<tt class="docutils literal">facebook.yaml</tt> file).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">FacebookRequestHandler</tt> also provides the functionality offered by
<tt class="docutils literal">djangofb.requires_login</tt> decorator. To use it, just set a
<tt class="docutils literal">requires_login</tt> attribute on your request handler.  You'll also want
to check against <tt class="docutils literal">self.redirecting</tt> to keep from performing
application logic when not-logged in.  <tt class="docutils literal">FacebookRequestHandler</tt>
provides a Facebook-friendly <tt class="docutils literal">self.redirect()</tt> that takes case of the
proper FBML response.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">FacebookRequestHandler</tt> also provides <tt class="docutils literal">memcache</tt>-backed &quot;user&quot;
messages tagged to a Facebook <tt class="docutils literal">uid</tt> and stored for a limited time.
This is a simple relative to Django's user messaging that makes use of
the always-available nature of App Engine's <tt class="docutils literal">memcache</tt>.</p>
<p>Finally, <tt class="docutils literal">FacebookCanvasHandler</tt> is a simple
<tt class="docutils literal">FacebookRequestHandler</tt> subclass that realizes that canvas requests
(for Facebook applications choosing to use the FBML route) are always
<tt class="docutils literal">HTTP POST</tt> and takes care of <tt class="docutils literal">self.redirecting</tt> among other things,
providing a <tt class="docutils literal">canvas()</tt> handler to use rather than <tt class="docutils literal">post()</tt>.</p>
<p>A simple example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">webappfb</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FacebookCanvasHandler</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">FacebookRequestHandler</span>
