Episode 5 (“A Dark Quiet Death”) of *Mythic Quest: Raven’s Banquet* (Apple TV+ Original) was an incredible gut punch for me.
It’s an entirely standalone episode (essentially a prologue to the series embedded mid-season as a pace shakeup). Highly
recommended. The rest of the show you can take or leave, but that episode was worth it. Subtler in its message/satire than
all the surrounding episodes, but also far more biting of a commentary.

(Adapted from a Mastodon post as it is the sort of small form blog post I used to make years ago, seemed relevant,
and I wanted something fresh on the blog. [Related Mastodon Post](https://smeap.com/@max/105319632505792057))
