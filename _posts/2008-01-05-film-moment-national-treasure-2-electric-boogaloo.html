title: 'Film of the Moment: National Treasure 2: Electric Boogaloo'
---
<p>Used an excuse the other night to visit the local popcorn stadium and saw the second National Treasure.  Similar watch once and forget it action fair, but unfortunately this one was downgraded in my mind from &quot;faux intelligent&quot; action to &quot;mindless&quot; action after my suspension of disbelief took one for the team.  (Way too early, I might add...  stretch of a bi-lingual, impromptu translation pun for the lose.)</p>
<p>Oddly, perhaps, more interesting and exciting to me in the entire course of the film was the attachment of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_To_Hook_Up_Your_Home_Theater">How To Hook Up Your Home Theater</a>, the first Goofy short attached to a film in nearly 2 score (or 4 decades, if you will) and the first non-Pixar animated short attached to a Disney film in about 15 years.  I felt it was a good sign for a possible big come-back for Disney Feature Animation with John Lasseter at the helm.  Particularly noteworthy was the use of digital animation techniques attempting to recreate the feel of the original classic shorts, and I thought it worked well...</p>
