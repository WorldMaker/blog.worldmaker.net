title: 'Odd Coincidences: The Beautiful Month of Ocotber'
---
I'm curious if there is some memo I missed from the secretive cabal that controls the English language [#]_ just recently because I'm certainly worried for the present state of college education, at least at the University of Louisville.  Two different organizations, both presumably using my tuition dollars to do so, recently, have plastered campus proclaiming activities in "Ocotber".  One of the organizations even pays full-time salaries for a couple of employees out of my tuition who supposedly should be double-checking this sort of thing with some of their salaried time...  Of course, I'm just an Engineer far be it for me to criticize the English usage of what was presumably some random English major on the other side of campus...

.. [#] It's certainly possible that I forgot to pay my dues again this year...
