title: 'Poem: Spring Weather Forecast?'
---
<p>I don't write poems that often.  I love writing, particularly fiction, but poems so often seem forced and unnatural.  When I do write poetry it is often rather formless.  I can't keep metrics straight, I rarely rhyme, and I just generally prefer the sounds of alliteration to those of meter or rhyme.</p>
<p>I don't know how to describe this poem and I'm not sure if I want to say too much or too little.  I don't know where I am at the moment on anything.  Things are crazy right now.  Don't read it, because it probably isn't very good.  I post it here so that I won't forget it.</p>

<div class="line">I had become weary and nearly despondent</div>
<div class="line">The weather of my daily routine had become a dismal gray sleet</div>
<div class="line">Sometimes I donât know who I am or why I do what I do</div>
<div class="line">Sometimes I transmogrify leaden emotions into pure bathetic gold</div>
<div class="line">Up ahead I could see nothing but hail storms of responsibility</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">All it takes is your smile and your laugh</div>
<div class="line">A ray of sunshine in my cramped calendar is all I ever want</div>
<div class="line">Sometimes I wish I could lose myself in the ocean of your eyes</div>
<div class="line">Sometimes I wonder what I must do to have the nerve to tell you</div>
<div class="line">Around you I donât notice the gray clouds in the sky</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Our deliberate gathering filled my days this week</div>
<div class="line">It was a heat wave of warm, low pressure winds to battle the cold</div>
<div class="line">Now I wish I had been able to ask sooner and had not been afraid</div>
<div class="line">Sometimes I wonder who I was to have been so naÃ¯ve</div>
<div class="line">I resolve to actually pursue my feelings rather than shy away</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I am not a fortune teller and have no psychic skills</div>
<div class="line">I can but predict the rain ahead and must not be afraid to seek the sun</div>
<div class="line">Now I can see naught before me but a chaos of spring storms</div>
<div class="line">Sometimes I forget it is up to me to try to break the clouds</div>
<div class="line">But does it take a Goddess to truly control the weather?</div>
