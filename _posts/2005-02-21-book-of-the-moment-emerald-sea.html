title: 'Book of the Moment: Emerald Sea'
---
<p>I've been reading John Ringo's works since he was featured on <a href="http://www.sluggy.com/">Sluggy Freelance</a>.  Ringo writes just about the closest I'll get to hard military sci-fi.  The key factor is his humor, which explains his Sluggy mention.  <i>Emerald Sea</i> is the continuation of <i>There Will Be Dragons</i>, a tale of a post-singularity ("death has been conquered") sci-fi universe falling back "pre-singularity" due to actions of several politicians.  I was amused by the end of one of the most recent chapters I've read containing some self-mockery as Ringo poked fun at his own writing style and habit of randomly creating characters, focusing them in a chapter or two, and then killing them off.  The passage may even be ironic in the fact that it involved a character who was introduced in this second book, and possibly might not survive till the end.  I think the character will survive, though, as he appears to be leading some where, but we'll see.</p>
