title: 'Creating In-Game Awards Part 3: Getting In-Game Awards Production Ready'
---
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=217">Part 1</a> Nick Gravelyn introduced a simple framework for displaying
award notifications in an XNA game. In <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=230">Part 2</a> Daniel Hanson improves
upon the award notifications adding in simple progress notification
support and simple support for multiple gamer profiles.</p>
<img alt="The Updated Awards Demo" class="align-right" src="http://media.worldmaker.net/blog/awardsdemo-images/awards-demo.jpg" />
<p>This article further improves upon the award notifications by better
following some XNA best practices, making the notifications more
configurable, more reusable, and more animated. The <a class="reference external" href="http://media.worldmaker.net/blog/AwardsDemo.zip">updated
AwardsDemo</a> application includes the full <a class="reference external" href="http://darcs.net">darcs</a> source code repository
of the changes with respect to the version presented in Part 2. This
article will mostly follow the repository's changes in chronological
order and you are welcome to follow along. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a> With basic source
control skills you can even attempt to cherry-pick some or part of the
changes made to get a customized version of the code.</p>
<p>(It is always a good idea to get into the habit of using a source
control system that you trust, even on the smallest projects.)</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Best Practice: Resource Strings</a></h1>
<p>In the AwardsDemo for Parts 1 and 2 there were several strings that were
left as constants at the top of source code files. This is an easily
made faux pas that can easily come to haunt a project as it nears
completion. It can be quite easy to forget where in a game's source code
a particular phrase or text is located, making it harder to tune the
output to its best and particularly making it much harder to translate
the game into other languages.</p>
<p>Even if you don't plan on releasing your game in multiple languages, it
is still handy to have all of your text in one place for easy changes.
It's also simply a good habit to get into, should the case ever arise
that you do want to release a multi-lingual game. Happily, Visual Studio
does a lot of work to make the best practice in this case (and many
similar cases) an easy habit to get into.</p>
<p>In XNA (and .NET as well) the place to store strings that may need
changing or will need translation (localization) is a &quot;Resource file&quot;.
Many Visual Studio templates will add one for you and adding one to a
project without one is just like adding any other source file.</p>
<p>When you add a resource file in a Visual Studio project it actually adds
two files to your project. The first is the <tt class="docutils literal">.resx</tt> file which is an
XML file that will store all of the strings (and whatever other resource
data you might need). The other is a <tt class="docutils literal">.designer.cs</tt> file and is an
auto-generated file that will change as you modify the <tt class="docutils literal">.resx</tt> file.
There aren't very many reasons to edit the designer file by hand. This
designer file provides you a handy class with static properties for
access to your resources, in a similar way to how you might use an
enum in your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-playerindex-rather-than-gamertag">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Using <tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex</tt> Rather Than <tt class="docutils literal">GamerTag</tt></a></h1>
<p>In Part 2 to differentiate between different players unlocking awards,
<tt class="docutils literal">GamerTag</tt> was chosen. This is an easy choice to use, but it can break
in subtle ways. <tt class="docutils literal">GamerTag</tt> is not guaranteed to be unique and local
profiles can share tags. The general best practice is that you should
only use the <tt class="docutils literal">GamerTag</tt> for display and for storing information you
should use something more appropriate.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex</tt> is a very appropriate choice for storing award progress
information for multiple players in memory. Several of XNA's examples
use <tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex</tt> everywhere, so it shouldn't be too startling to see
it here as well. <tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex</tt> provides a few useful benefits: it will
be used in the revised notifications (which is discussed later in this
article) and it should make more obvious the workflows that should be
used with the awards component.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>When a player signs in (ie, in response to
<tt class="docutils literal">SignedInGamer.SignedIn</tt>), load the player's stored progress
information (if there is any).</li>
<li>When a player signs out (ie, in response to
<tt class="docutils literal">SignedInGamer.SignedOut</tt>), save the player's award progress as
necessary and then clear all of the progress information for that
<tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using <tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex</tt> in this fashion should make it more obvious that
the awards component should not be storing more progress data than there
are currently active players. It should also make it more obvious that
the progress information should probably be stored in the appropriate
per-user storage areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-power-to-the-notifications">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">More Power to the Notifications</a></h1>
<p>In Part 1 and Part 2 all of the drawing code was in <tt class="docutils literal">AwardsComponent</tt>.
While this is certainly a valid way to do it, it also has a certain
inflexibility should one wish to customize the way notifications are
drawn, or to reuse the notification drawing code to draw other
interesting screens for awards.</p>
<p>For in game awards it is often useful to provide a screen listing all of
the possible awards and their progress for that player. In Part 2,
<em>Gears of War 2</em> is cited as an example of a best-in-class game for
in-game award displays and <em>Gears of War 2</em> is a good example here as
well: in between games, players can examine their progress in the &quot;war
journal&quot; which displays awards in much the same way that the in-action
notifications do. It makes a lot of sense to make the drawing code for
awards amenable to just this sort of reuse.</p>
<p>To this aim, the drawing code was moved into two new classes:
<tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt>. <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> is meant to
be a configurable display of an Award. <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> is a
subclass of <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> that configures the output to be the most
useful for in-game notifications. <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> can also be
customized in many ways without subclassing it, using the various
properties that it exposes.  The updated demo uses <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt>
customized in this fashion to provide the hints of how to unlock the
awards.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> follows a relatively simple pattern:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GameTime</span> <span class="n">gt</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SpriteBatch</span> <span class="n">batch</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt> method is expected to be called in an appropriate place
during your game's <tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt> and takes a <tt class="docutils literal">GameTime</tt> object so that
any animation it needs to perform can be correctly timed.
<tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> itself doesn't actually have any animation, but it is
still provided so that subclasses can use it. (That is also the reason
that both methods are marked <tt class="docutils literal">virtual</tt> so that subclasses can
<tt class="docutils literal">override</tt> them to do things like further customized rendering or
animation.) The <tt class="docutils literal">Render</tt> method is then the one used during the game's
<tt class="docutils literal">Draw</tt>. It is named <tt class="docutils literal">Render</tt> to distinguish that it renders to a
given <tt class="docutils literal">SpriteBatch</tt> rather than handling every aspect of the drawing.
By accepting the <tt class="docutils literal">SpriteBatch</tt> as an argument, it gives you the
freedom to prime the <tt class="docutils literal">SpriteBatch</tt> in whichever ways that you need to
prepare it for particular layering, alpha blending, or other needs that
your game may have.</p>
<p>In breaking out <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> from <tt class="docutils literal">AwardsComponent</tt> two more
useful information properties were added to <tt class="docutils literal">Award</tt> that are useful to
display to players: <tt class="docutils literal">Award.Hint</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Award.Description</tt>. These two
fields come directly from the Xbox's Achievement menu: <tt class="docutils literal">Award.Hint</tt> is
shown when the award is locked to provide a hint to a player on how to
unlock it. <tt class="docutils literal">Award.Description</tt> is then the text shown when a player
has unlocked the award and can reveal how an award was rewarded, some
pithy expression about the award, or anything else that might be
interesting to a player that unlocked the reward. (<tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt>
displays both with the same property, <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay.ShowDescription</tt>,
and determines automatically which string to use based upon the current
award progress.)</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> also takes into account the <tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex</tt> when
rendering an award. This can be important in multiplayer games so that
players can tell at a glance which player a notification refers to.
The notifications on the Xbox 360 all use the &quot;ring of light&quot; to mark
which player(s) a notification is for. The updated notification
backgrounds included in the demo provide a subtle <tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex</tt>
marker based upon the &quot;ring of light&quot;. Notice the subtle green glow in
the upper-left corner (<tt class="docutils literal">PlayerIndex.One</tt>) here:</p>
<img alt="Focus on the &quot;ring of light&quot; glow" src="http://media.worldmaker.net/blog/awardsdemo-images/awards-demo-index.jpg" />
<div class="section" id="using-bars-to-assess-progress">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Using Bars to Assess Progress</a></h2>
<p>Part 2 added the concept of partial progress to awards and provided
counters to display that progress information. Progress bars are
important ways to provide that sort of progress information at a glance
and also happen to use a few techniques that are good to learn in XNA
and often become relatively common patterns. So common, in fact, that
the progress bar code in the updated demo is a good microcosm to explore
the updated rendering code, and once the progress bar portions of it are
well understood the rest should follow.</p>
<p>The progress bars make use of two textures, a back and a fill texture
which are expected to be of the same size. The <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> class
has a set of constants based upon the texture size:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// The height/width (square) of the progress bar textures</span>
<span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarSize</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">16</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// The width of the left/right edge for the progress bar</span>
<span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarEdgeWidth</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// The width of the stretchy middle for the progress bar</span>
<span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarMidWidth</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarSize</span> <span class="p">-</span> <span class="m">2</span> <span class="p">*</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarEdgeWidth</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The texture this version of the demo uses for progress bars are both 16
pixels by 16 pixels square. The textures are split horizontally into
three sections: the left end cap, the right end cap and a middle portion
that will be stretched to appropriately fill an <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt>. (These
constants assume that both end caps are the same size.) The
<tt class="docutils literal">ProgressBarMidWidth</tt> constant is intentionally written to show that
the three constants are interrelated, even though the math that the
compiler has to perform here is trivial (the mid-width here is 6
pixels).</p>
<p>Using these constants, source rectangles are defined:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// These source rectangles deconstruct the progress bar textures</span>
<span class="k">readonly</span> <span class="n">Rectangle</span> <span class="n">pbarSourceLeft</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Rectangle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarEdgeWidth</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarSize</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">readonly</span> <span class="n">Rectangle</span> <span class="n">pbarSourceMid</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Rectangle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ProgressBarEdgeWidth</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarMidWidth</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarSize</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">readonly</span> <span class="n">Rectangle</span> <span class="n">pbarSourceRight</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Rectangle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ProgressBarEdgeWidth</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarMidWidth</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">ProgressBarEdgeWidth</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ProgressBarSize</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Source rectangles are passed to a <tt class="docutils literal">SpriteBatch</tt> to chop the textures
into segments.  These source rectangles are used in conjunction with
destination rectangles to easily handle several forms of scaling and
stretching of parts of a texture. Source rectangles refer to the
coordinates of the source texture and destination rectangles refer to
the screen coordinates where the source rectangle will be displayed.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay.CalculateProgressBar</tt> (called by <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay.Update</tt>
when appropriate) calculates the various destination rectangles for the
six source regions of the progress bar: left, middle, and right for both
the background and the fill textures. The background destination
rectangles are built to fill the entire region available for the
progress bar. The fill rectangle is sized to represent the current
percentage of progress unlocked. The important line here is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// This is the amount of the progress bar that is filled.</span>
<span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">progfilled</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">MathHelper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Lerp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">progwidth</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Progress</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Percentage</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This uses <tt class="docutils literal">MathHelper.Lerp</tt> to calculate the amount of space that the
progress bar should show as filled. <tt class="docutils literal">MathHelper</tt> is a useful
swiss-army knife than can be useful in many situations. <tt class="docutils literal">Lerp</tt> is a
shorthand name, used often in game and graphics programming, for <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">linear
interpolation</a>. Given a range and a float between zero and one,
<tt class="docutils literal">Lerp</tt> returns a value in the range that corresponds to the float's
position on an imaginary line.  <tt class="docutils literal">Lerp</tt> is one of a handful of
functions in <tt class="docutils literal">MathHelper</tt> that expect a float between zero and one.
The easiest way to think of this range is that of a percentage:
percentages are properly between 0% and 100% and easily expressed as
decimals (floats) between zero and one. Based upon the progress
percentage <tt class="docutils literal">Lerp</tt> returns a value between zero and our total available
space for the progress bar (<tt class="docutils literal">progwidth</tt>), which is all that is needed
to determine the amount of that space that should be filled for the
progress bar.</p>
<p>One good resource on the reasons why these functions are normalized to
work with floats from zero to one can be found in <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2007/05/03/transitions-part-one-the-importance-of-curves.aspx">Shawn Hargreaves'
post on the importance of curves</a> in relation to transition effects
and the game state management samples. Some of the same techniques can
be used to experiment with the transitions employed in the
<tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> class.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="animating-the-notification">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Animating the Notification</a></h1>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> is a subclass of <tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> specifically for
use in the notification popups presented by <tt class="docutils literal">AwardsComponent</tt>. Since
<tt class="docutils literal">AwardDisplay</tt> takes care of all the important stuff for drawing award
progress information to the screen, <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> can focus on
timing how long the notification lasts. In addition,
<tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> adds in simple animation during its transition on
and then off the screen. <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> also animates the
progress bar for a notification.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> is a very simple state machine <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[2]</a> which can be
easily diagrammed <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id4">[3]</a>:</p>
<img alt="Showing -&gt; Visible -&gt; Hiding -&gt; Finished -&gt; Showing" src="http://media.worldmaker.net/blog/awardsdemo-images/notifstate.png" />
<p><tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> has four possible animation states, which are
named and documented in the <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification.State</tt> enum. Most of
the states are simply timed: a progress float is incremented each
frame based upon the elapsed time and the state's length <tt class="docutils literal">TimeSpan</tt>.
This float is kept between zero and one and is thus a percentage of time
elapsed for that state. As mentioned earlier in this article, floats
between zero and one, percentages, are quite useful and many functions
are optimized to work with them.</p>
<p>The remaining state transition that isn't a simple timer happens when
the method <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification.Notify</tt> is called (as is marked in the
diagram above). This method sets the <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> up for a new
animation. It also sets a few values that are used to animate the
progress bar.</p>
<div class="section" id="animating-the-progress-bar">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Animating the Progress Bar</a></h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">AwardsComponent</tt> enqueues notifications based upon
<tt class="docutils literal">Award.ProgressIncrement</tt>. As Part 2 points out, this is something
that <em>Gears of War 2</em> does in order to balance between too many
notifications and not enough. What Part 2 does not point out is that
<em>Gears of War 2</em> also steadily animates the progress bar. In that game
the notifications appear with the round increment, but then quickly
&quot;catch up&quot; to any additional progress that is made. This is particularly
useful on some of the notifications to let a player know to &quot;keep doing
what they are doing&quot;.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification.Notify</tt> sets the starting progress to that round
increment, but keeps track of that award's real progress information as
well. During the &quot;visible&quot; state of <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> the progress
information is interpolated between the starting round interval and the
current progress.</p>
<p>There are several interpolation techniques that could be used for this,
including <tt class="docutils literal">MathHelper.Lerp</tt> described above. In this case
<tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt> uses a manually-tweaked <tt class="docutils literal">Curve</tt> file, created
with the <a class="reference external" href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/utilities/curveeditor">Curve Editor</a> utility, called <tt class="docutils literal">ProgressCurve.xml</tt>. A curve
file is added into the content pipeline like the art assets and the
Curve Editor is a useful visual tool for designing mathematical
functions that can be used in any number of places in a game.</p>
<p>Here's what the <tt class="docutils literal">ProgressCurve.xml</tt> looks like in the editor:</p>
<img alt="Progress Curve in Curve Editor" src="http://media.worldmaker.net/blog/awardsdemo-images/progress-curve.jpg" />
<p>In the Curve Editor the x-axis can be thought of as the input range for
the curve and the y-axis can be thought of as the output range for the
curve. In this particular curve the range we are interested in is
between zero and one: the input is to be the state's timer percentage.
The output that we are interested in is then another number between zero
and one, which might be thought of as the &quot;real progress percentage&quot;. As
the curve nears 100% (1.0 on the y-axis) we get closer to whatever the
player's true progress is.</p>
<p>In this case the idea was to highlight the round increment for a good
period (the first 30% of the timer), quickly (but smoothly) ramp up to
near-current progress (reaching nearly 80% of the current progress
around 44% of the timer). The last 20% of the timer is then &quot;real-time&quot;
showing 100% of the current progress information. It was tweaked several
times in the Curve Editor to produce a final result that looked
interesting when pushing the buttons quite quickly in the updated
AwardsDemo.</p>
<p>Curves like this may seem complicated at first, but the Curve Editor is
a powerful tool to get mathematical formulas in an easy to use visual
fashion. Curves edited in this fashion can replace the simple curves
offered in <tt class="docutils literal">MathHelper</tt> like <tt class="docutils literal">Lerp</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">SmoothStep</tt>. If curves
are edited for the range between zero and one in both axes it is a
simple matter to replace an instance of one of these built-in functions
with a custom curve. Sticking to this range also makes it simple to
chain curve evaluation with these built-in functions and even with other
curve evaluations.</p>
<p>For example, the progress indication animation in <tt class="docutils literal">AwardNotification</tt>
began as simply a <tt class="docutils literal">MathHelper.Lerp</tt>, but this did not seem interesting
enough and the curve was created to make the animation more interesting,
but it still uses the <tt class="docutils literal">Lerp</tt> to convert from the curve's output range
to the progress range.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Go Forth and Award Your Players</a></h1>
<p>At this point the updated AwardDemo project is even more polished than
in Parts 1 and 2. It is also arguably better at this point than the
in-game notifications of many retail Xbox 360 games, albeit most of them
exclusively rely on the 360's dashboard notifications. Xbox Live Indie
Games don't get 360 achievements and thus don't get the 360's dashboard
access to achievement progress screens and notifications. This project,
taking some cues from <em>Gears of War 2</em>, which has some of the strongest
in-game notifications and progress screens, hopefully provides a great
tool for any Xbox Live indie game developer to have a good,
polished-looking awards system for their games.</p>
