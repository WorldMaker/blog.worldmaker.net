title: The Tsunami Challenge
---
<p>I've just put my money where my mouth is and donated $50 to <a href="https://secure.ga3.org/02/asia_earthquake04">Oxfam America</a> to help care for those affected by the recent tsunami.  My friend tas at <a href="http://www.loadedmouth.com">LoadedMouth</a> has set up a page for tracking blogger donations in his <a href="http://tsunami.loadedmouth.com">Blogger Tsunami Challenge</a> and is pushing to spread the word by creating matching challenges.  Here's mine:</p>

<blockquote>The first person to let me know they've matched my $50 contribution can have the main character in my <a href="fiction/mythoi">in progress novel</a> named after them.  If you ask nicely or exceed my contribution I could even give you a glimpse at my research/notes and let you shape the development of "your" character.  Even if I don't complete the novel you can brag to all your friends that you "once were the main character in a novel". (People after the first are welcome to ask for secondary characters to be named after them...)</blockquote>
