title: Bruckheimer's Second Pirates Film
---
<p>I was much less angered by the &quot;just wait for part 2&quot; ending of Pirates 2, than any of the guys I went with.  I thought it was a good action film, and I didn't have anywhere near as much pain sitting through it than I had trying to watch X-Men 3.  Perhaps because I didn't expect much.  I'd probably see the 3rd when it hits theaters.</p>
<p>My lone disappointment, and it's a bit minor, was that I wanted to see the musical score reference <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opuscds.com/track/71938">The Flying Dutchman Overture</a>.</p>
