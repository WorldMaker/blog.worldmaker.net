title: Paypal 1, Spammers 0

Well, I found this hilarious.  I just got a fradulent spam message trying to get my PayPal password from me (in industry terms this is called a "phish").  The funny thing about it was that in their attempt to accurately copy the PayPal email message format they forgot to remove this one particular block from the email:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.paypal.com" title="PayPal">
<h3>Protect Your Account Info</h3>
<p>Make sure you never provide your password to fraudulent websites.</p>

<p>To safely and securely access the PayPal website or your account, open up a new web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer or Netscape) and type in the PayPal URL (http://www.paypal.com/).</p>

<p>PayPal will never ask you to enter your password in an email.</p>

<p>For more information on protecting yourself from fraud, please review our Security Tips at http://www.paypal.com/securitytips</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to feel sorry, though, for those who make the same mistake as these spammers did and don't read this block.</p>
