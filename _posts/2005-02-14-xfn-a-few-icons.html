title: 'XFN: A few icons...'
---
<p>As promised, behold my crappy Gimp skills!  I've created a few [XFN] icons.  I started with the more commonly used ones.  They are based on the FOAF smiley face without a mouth iconography.  Here's what I've created:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/images/xfn/friend.png" alt="Friend" /> Friend</li>
<li><img src="/images/xfn/acquaintance.png" alt="Acquaintance" /> Acquaintance</li>
<li><img src="/images/xfn/contact.png" alt="Contact" /> Contact</li>
<li><img src="/images/xfn/met.png" alt="met" /> met (Meant to symbolozie a hand shake, or perhaps two feet in opposite directions, as if face to face)</li>
</ul>
