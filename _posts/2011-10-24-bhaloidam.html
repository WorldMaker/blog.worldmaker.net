<p>If you haven't already, you should definitely back Corvus Elrod's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/corvuse/bhaloidam-an-indie-tabletop-storytelling-game">Bhaloidam on Kickstarter</a>. There are only a few days left to do so. Corvus' Bhaloidam is a very unique storytelling platform as RPG-like boardgame (or boardgame-like RPG) and well worth pushing further towards its Kickstarter goal. Corvus explains things pretty well on the Kickstarter page, so go there.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed every opportunity I've had to work with Bhaloidam (or as it was previously referred to as the HoneyComb Engine), both in having played it a couple of times with Corvus and friends and having experimented with it in Python. Now that Bhaloidam is stable and about to be published in a big way, I'm working on slowly picking back up the Python work and bring it up to date.</p>
<p>The first baby step here is that I'm giving the library and assorted accoutrements a proper name, which is now <a class="reference external" href="http://madiolahb.appspot.com">Madiolahb</a>. Obviously not entirely original as it is simply the reverse of Bhaloidam, but I like that it lends some focus to &quot;lahb&quot;; my intended path for the library and toolset is to be a laboratory of interesting component parts to build Bhaloidam-based games and structures in computer-mediated spaces. As a first example of this laboratory approach I'm trying to push towards as rewrite, streamline, and expand upon Madiolahb, I'm opening up the idea of a standardized JSON format for tool chaining (similar in ways to unix pipelining) within Madiolahb itself and as a potential interchange format between other Bhaloidam-based tools. <a class="reference external" href="http://madiolahb.appsopt.com/docs/json.html">Madiolahb JSON Schemata</a> is a first stab at documenting this and comments are welcome.</p>
<p>More to do and more to come. (Don't forget to support Bhaloidam over on Kickstarter.)</p>
