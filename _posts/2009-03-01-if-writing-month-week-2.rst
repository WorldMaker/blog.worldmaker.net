This week I had a heck of a cold and on the flipside of that cold I got some good work done on my game for my startup. So a few hours today for `"Amongst the Stars" Release 2`__ I "merely" fleshed out the interior of the ship (the *USS Rosser* being the name chosen late last week).  The game has expanded almost double to 2253 words, 8 rooms, and 13 other things. As far as Week 2's provided goals exploration is still the form of the "puzzles" and they aren't much by any definition.  On the other hand I've prepared for Week 3's provided goals, which was the general direction I was already heading, by populating the ship with a few NPCs.
