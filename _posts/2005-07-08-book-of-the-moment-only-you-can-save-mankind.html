<p>Taking a break from <a href="/node/101">Wicked</a> (slower reading than I expected; interesting but not 'gripping')...  I blew through Volume 2 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0930289595/worldmakeronl-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1">The Doll's House</a>) of <i>The Sandman</i> yesterday, and was myself blown away.</p>

<p>I also started headlong into <i>Only You Can Save Mankind</i>.  Terry Pratchett (PTerry) is currently the only writer I get emails when his American publisher (HarperCollins) releases a book, and I will be there within a couple of days to pick up my copy.  This book marks the first HarperCollins release of Pratchett's decade+ year old Johnny Maxwell trilogy, the first kid's books he wrote.  (His later kid's books include The Bromeliad Trilogy and his Discworld kid's books including Carnegie-winner <i>The Amazing Maurice</i>.)  His kid's books are always just as enjoyable as his adult works, and usually only differ in length, protagonist age, and humor cleanliness.  <i>Only You...</i> seems to prefigure some of his later humor (he loves the pronounce punctuation gag), but also provides an interesting contrast in that it has more of a "science fiction" feel than his later works...  you could see this one actually happening in our world.</p>

<p>My biggest gripe is that it is simply too short and there will be a waiting period until the next rerelease.  (It was cool to have The Bromeliad Trilogy released in a single volume.)</p>
