title: Do I even want a job?
---
<p>Yesterday was yet another resume-sending day in what feels like a long fruitless job search.  I could only think of three companies I felt like sending my resume to yesterday, and two of those didn't have a way to apply.  I feel real stupid because I've really lost a lot of confidence in the business world.  I'm not sure really if I actually want another job at this point, the way I feel like I've been mistreated.  The money might be nice, but I don't really know what I want to do anymore in the job world, and I'm getting kind of fed-up at the beauracratic nature of business, the slow pace, and the lack of anything really in the way of response to inquiries and applications.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just impatient, but the "pace of business" just seems so glacial.  I spoke with one particular company for over two months and they sounded like they were interested, but then they just didn't seem to be moving on it.  I guess I could contact them again, but the initial enthusiasm has drained away.</p>

<p>The only reason I <i>need</i> a job right now is for my degree requirements (required 2 coops for the BS, 3 for the M.Eng).  I'm tempted to just grab a work study here for my second, like foreign nationals and other people who can't get a "real job".  Another possibility I've considered is to just take a semester off and get real involved in some big Open Source project like Mozilla or Mono.  If I wrote a somewhat detailed coop report on how much I learned from the experience I figure the CECS Department would accept it.  I'll remain a poor college student, not getting paid what I think I'm worth, but I'll at least get <i>something</i> in the way of actual experience.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas for good companies I could send my resume to?  Anyone want to help me get my foot in the door somewhere?</p>
