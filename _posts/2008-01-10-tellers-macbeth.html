title: Teller's MacBeth
---
<p>I've been reading the essays about the production of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pennandteller.com/03/coolstuff/tellersmacbethindex.html">Teller's MacBeth</a> (via Niel Gaiman's blog) and I'm salivating...  it sounds like so much fun and there are just some great bits and pieces in the essays.  I wish I was closer to New Jersey or DC to actually catch a show.  The DC performance lasts through my Spring Break and I'm starting to wonder if that might not be an excuse to visit DC for the break...</p>
<p>Also, check out the rest of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pennandteller.com/03/coolstuff/tellersessays.html">Teller's Essays</a> for some other interesting topics.</p>
