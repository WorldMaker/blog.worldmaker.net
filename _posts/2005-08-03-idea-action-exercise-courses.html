title: 'Idea: "Action" Exercise Courses'
---
<p>I was thinking that someone could create fun "action" cardio-workout courses.  Instead of the Theme Park "action" rides where you let a cart do the walking.  Think about any clich&egrav;d foot chase you've seen in an action movie, and it could be a simple story.  "Dr. Yes set up a bomb on the top of this building...  you have 10 minutes to reach it and 'disarm' it."  "Watch these people on this crowded street for a jewel thief and give chase to that person."</p>

<p>A person might not have the stamina to "beat" a course on the first time, but you could still make even "losing" fun.  You could even segment courses into "difficulty" levels.</p>

<p>The impetus for the idea came from the idea for an "advanced" course involving the standard movie sequence of chasing someone across several rail cars of a moving train.  Obviously this one would take a person being in reasonably good shape and would require quite a bit of good supervision, but it would probably be "fun".</p>

<p>Add a musical score and "DVDs of your action adventure on sale in the Lobby!" and you have a commercial venture.</p>
