<p>Got the official rejection from the Google Summer of Code initiative, today.  Needless to say it was disheartening, but considering that 5,000+ other people were rejected I can't take it too personally.  I'm going to seek out what criticism I can get and probably still work on at least portions of my original plan.</p>
