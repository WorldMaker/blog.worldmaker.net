title: 'Fiasco Poker: Simple Playing Card Variation for Fiasco'
---
<p>I've been threatening to write it down for too long now, so I finally wrote down how to play <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/">Fiasco</a> with ordinary playing cards instead of dice. I call it <a class="reference external" href="http://sdrv.ms/1aVG06f">Fiasco Poker</a>. I've been meaning to use it alongside a playset, but I still haven't written that yet. I also think it could use playing card-specific Turn and Aftermath tables, but I haven't even started on that either.</p>
<p>Feedback is welcome. I hope it makes for fun sessions for everyone that is willing to try it.</p>
