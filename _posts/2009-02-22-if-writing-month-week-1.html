title: 'IF Writing Month: Week 1'
---
<p>Behold, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://if.unlore.com/amongst1/">Amongst the Stars</a>&quot;, my current work in progress for IF Writing Month and my writing debut in Inform 7. At the end of Week 1 I've gone subtly over the requirements for Week 1 and actually ended up closer to the goals for the end of Week 2.  I wrote 1175 words about 3 rooms and 5 other things.  There's the setup for a very simple plot event (scene) and even a rudimentary &quot;puzzle&quot;.  It should almost be entirely obvious to figure out from the genre context.</p>
