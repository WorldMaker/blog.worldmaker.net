title: 'Miscellanea: Request for Comments, Darcsforge'
---
<p>I was in the process of writing a custom commenting system because I wanted
threaded comments, OpenID, and Gravatar, at the very least, and there's
currently no existing Django aggregation that supports all of those.  I got
maybe 85% done on that when I discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://intensedebate.com/">Intense Debate</a> and as you may
have noticed, I've gone ahead and installed it.  On the one hand I like
letting someone else focus on making things cool, and it has all of the
features that I was looking for and almost had in my custom thing.  On the
other hand right now the tool is JS-only, which means that non-JS enabled
browsers (like lynx, which I often test my sites against, actually) don't see
the comments.  So, does anyone have a strong opinion for/against Intense
Debate?  Does the social network aspects make up for the requirement of
JavaScript/JScript/ECMAScript?  I still feel torn between the power of
finishing my own custom thing and ease of using someone else's work and
continued innovation...</p>

<p>In interesting news in case anyone is following <a class="reference external" href="http://darcsforge.code.worldmaker.net/">Darcsforge</a>, I've actually
been working on it recently.  I've just about finished a new feature that I
think makes my small, simple, goofy issue tracker quite a bit more actually
useful: <a class="reference external" href="http://repos.worldmaker.net/darcsforge/main/docs/.build/html/orkin.html#repository-based-issue-tracking">Repository-based Issue Tracking</a>.  This was a &quot;two weekend hack&quot;
project of sorts and was a nice way to get back into the code base.  It
encouraged me to write the first bit of code necessary to get the file
annotation information.  That will be helpful when it comes time to get back
to finishing the file-browser stuff.</p>
<p>Also, I went ahead and purchased
<tt class="docutils literal">darcsforge.org</tt> to make the project a little more respectable and
eventually I might move the homepage of the project from its current home
on my personal code site to something like <tt class="docutils literal">self.darcsforge.org</tt>.</p>

<p>I got a big kick out of act one of <a class="reference external" href="http://drhorrible.com/">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a> and
I can't wait to see the next act soon.  The first webisode of <em>Heroes</em>'
&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/video/webisodes/#vid=275540">Going Postal</a>&quot; was somewhat &quot;meh&quot;, not awful, but not spectacular either.</p>
