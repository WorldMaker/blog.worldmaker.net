title: Downcasting C# Generics...
---
<p>This is one of the things that becomes stickier and more annoying due to my near constant jumping back and forth between Python (web apps and one-off data wrangling scripts) and C# (the current big project).  But, it's bugged me for a while...  It would be nice to have an easier way to handle the many situations of having on hand a <tt class="docutils literal">List&lt;DerivedClass&gt;</tt> and needing to make use of that as a <tt class="docutils literal">IList&lt;BaseClass&gt;</tt>.  I realize that it's the sort of magic meta-programming often frowned upon in strongly-typed languages but I would be so happy if Generic Collections could provide even just <tt class="docutils literal">IEnumerable&lt;BaseType&gt;</tt> for the base-chain and interfaces...</p>
