title: 'Display & Rant: A Podcast of Show and Tell From Opinionated Adults'
---
<p>My friend <a class="reference external" href="http://jordanwages.com">Jordan Wages</a> and I have started a podcast we are calling <em>Display &amp; Rant</em>. <a class="reference external" href="http://dsplynrnt.com/ep0">Display &amp; Rant Episode 0</a> has been posted. We're working on our ideas for Episode 1.</p>
<p>Our show notes are on slides, so we are recommending you watch the slide cast version of it (at the top of the page linked above), but for those that prefer more mainstream podcasting tools, you can also <a class="reference external" href="http://dsplynrnt.com/itunes">subscribe to Display &amp; Rant on iTunes</a>.</p>
<p>Feedback is welcome. I'm looking forward to seeing where this show goes.</p>
