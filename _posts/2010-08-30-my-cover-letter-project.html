title: My Cover Letter Project
---
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://cdn.worldmaker.net/coverletter/gnmar10.08.love">Galaxy's Next Most Awesome Rookie: Earth Edition: Max Battcher's Cover
Letter: The Game</a> is the many-subtitled mini-game I've developed as
something of an interactive cover letter <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a>, in part to make up for my
lack of ability to get to this year's PAX <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[2]</a>. In case you think there
is room for another sub-title in the game's name, rest assured that
today I also sent out a couple of &quot;Special Editions&quot;. To play it, all
you need is <a class="reference external" href="http://love2d.org">Löve 2D</a> 0.6.2.</p>
<p>This project was an interestingly tough creative challenge for me. It's
tough trying to creatively write about things like &quot;why you should hire
me&quot;, and some of the things that appear on a resume (or don't, for
various reasons), and keep them somewhat light-hearted and almost
entirely skip-able. I'm not quite sure that I succeeded with what I was
going for, but I do hope the final game feels at least half as silly and
sweet as I had meant it to be.</p>
<p>At final count the game consists of nearly 3200 words of dialog and is
somewhere shy of 560 words of dialog in the minimal path through the
game. The script is 27 pages in Celtx PDF output, and I am curious if
there is any sort of easy pages-to-minutes rule of thumb for KeyLimePie
projects akin to screenwriting's established 1:1 estimate. I'm pretty
sure there isn't, but this is the first finished project. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id4">[3]</a></p>
<p>On the technical side, I do feel that I succeeded in what I set out to
accomplish. As I mentioned in my last blog post, <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/2010/aug/09/i-love-keylimepie/">I Löve KeyLimePie</a>,
the <a class="reference external" href="http://love2d.org">Löve 2D</a> KeyLimePie client was written specifically with this
project in mind. I wanted to build my cover letter in Lua because that
is a language that many game companies use for scripting and it seemed
useful to prove that I grok it.</p>
<p>Those that are curious may even notice that this marks the first
KeyLimePie client I've open sourced in any capacity thus far, as the
<tt class="docutils literal">.love</tt> file itself is simply an unencrypted zip archive.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you try playing this &quot;game&quot;, and if you have any
thoughts or criticism on it.</p>
