title: Pondering the Opportunity Cost of a Graduate Education
---
All I seem to have right now are questions about ponderous unhappenings and perplexing uncertainties...  

Last week I interviewed with some of the Windows Live team at Microsoft, but more on the side of the native client applications that fall under the Live umbrella (Live Mail ne√© Outlook Express, Messenger, ...).  I got an almost immediate rejection when I got back, and I spent several days snowed in without internet or cable stewing on the interview. I've got some interesting take-aways from the interview, but I'm not yet certain how any of them help me.

I had hoped that the interview would narrow some of my uncertainty about the future, but that hasn't happened.  There aren't any easy "action items" for my TODO list.

I need some sort of income or funding...  there's nothing like being broke and packed with student debt in an inflationary economy.  I keep wondering if I would have been better off if I had not gone for my Master's degree...  I'm not sure if the extra degree that I earned was worth its cost, particularly including some of it's possible opportunity costs my mind has been taunting me with.

The jobs I most want right now: don't exist, are not hiring, or don't seem to be considering me.  I am geographically disadvantaged and too opinionated and too picky about which jobs I want and possibly even not talented enough.  Not that much of that is news to me, only that the current economy shines such a lovely magnifying glass to it...

Well, back to staying up too late working on projects that aren't currently generating income but might some day...
