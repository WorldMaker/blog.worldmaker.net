<ul>
<li>Why have fundamentalist christianity and atheist Objectivism become such strange bedfellows?</li>
<li>Thanks to the Apache Friends for <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html">XAMPP</a>.  Better, free (beer/speech) than Nusphere, my previous distro.</li>
<li>Congratulations to our Corporate America "Friends" for winning a <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/MGM_v_Grokster/04-480.pdf">unanimous Supreme Court overturn</a> of the Grokster decision.  (For the sarcasm challenged: A technology creator distributing a product with an "implied" usage of breaking Copyright law is now liable for its users' violations.)</li>
