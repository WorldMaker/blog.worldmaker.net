<p class="last">Can a video game teach?  This month asks the personal question: What
have you learned from a video game?  The goal is to focus on the
positive, the socially responsible lessons, and to show that, at
least sometimes, a video game is more than just &quot;a video game&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p>It's very easy for me to unequivocally announce that I've learned a
great deal from video games.  Most obviously I've studied video games
for years with an eye to building them, but even ignoring that and
trivia picked up from game-like encyclopedias and trivia games, there is
a wealth of knowledge that I've picked up from decades of game
playing...  To a large extent, I would not be the person that I am if it
weren't for video games and the lessons they had to teach me.</p>

<p>It was the early 90s and my father had decided to give up his executive
position for the chance to invest in his own business.  He searched the
trade journals looking for a franchise to invest in and eventually he
settled upon the idea of franchising an LA-based business called
<em>Futurekids</em>.  What's left of the franchisees have diversified, adding
in more consulting-oriented services, selling curriculum to schools and
helping non-profit community centers, but my father started where most
franchisees started: Computer learning centers for kids.</p>
<p>As I said, my parents were ahead of their time: They put several years
of sweat and tears into a business solely predicated on teaching through
computers; everything from teaching basic familiarity to necessary
computer skills to even teaching through computer games.  My parents
realized that you can teach interesting concepts simply through the
&quot;fun&quot; of video games, and Futurekids' curriculum encouraged it often
through more of a &quot;summer camp&quot; mentality rather than a class.  My
parents never made enough money with their franchise operation and
eventually they had to close their modest two learning centers.  Perhaps
it was always doomed to failure, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1" name="id1">[1]</a> but my parents tried their best
and put a lot of work into it.</p>

<p>I guess that I'm the person that came out with some of the biggest gains
from the business attempt.  I was curriculum guinea pig and contingent
IT staff and my after school care when my parents were busy and I wasn't
doing something to help: I was given just about free reign to play on any
of the many machines around me, most of which I knew intimately what
software was installed and ready to play, because I had helped install
it in late night floppy-disk chains...</p>

<h1><a id="i-survived-the-edutainment-boom-of-the-90s" name="i-survived-the-edutainment-boom-of-the-90s">I Survived the Edutainment Boom of the 90s</a></h1>
<p>Because of my parents and the focus of their business, I grew up
surrounded by just about every major edutainment, a portmanteau of
education and entertainment, title on the market.  I experienced an
amazing history of games as both teaching tools and entertainment,
simultaneously.</p>
<p>It seems obvious to me that my parents weren't the only ones ahead of
their time, spending money on computer games: the years that my parents
worked on <em>Futurekids</em> roughly coincided with the big Edutainment boom
where a diverse range of developers and publishers leapt entirely over
this round table question of &quot;Do games teach?&quot; to land squarely with the
assertion that &quot;Games <strong>should</strong> teach.&quot;</p>

<p>In the era of the Williams' <em>Sierra</em> it was &quot;obvious&quot; that a
well-rounded games publisher needed a solid foundation of edutainment
titles in their line-up.  I can't help but think that we've lost
something major when publishers stopped asking new and upcoming
developers to cut their teeth on fun games for kids, with an educational
twist, and instead started focusing on movie and television licenses as
the starter kits for young development houses.</p>
<p>If there is a genre that is truly dead right now on the marketplace it
seems obvious that &quot;edutainment&quot; is it, and walking through a software
aisle still sometimes pains me to see what's left of the &quot;education&quot;
titles.  Sometimes it still seems like the equivalent of walking into
a bookstore and seeing only a graffitied shell were once stood the
Children's Literature section, a war-torn reminder of the changing tides
of business.</p>
<p>A good example of what we seem to have lost, something equally ahead of
its time, were the &quot;eco-games&quot; of edutainment.  Riding the 90s push for
recycling these games came before the modern <em>Inconvenient Truth</em> green
movement, but I don't see any modern equivalents.  Easily dated by its
use of a very early text-to-speech synthesizer, <a class="reference" href="http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?id=4479">Eco-Saurus</a> had kids
recycling and conserving energy in order to help a friendly space
dinosaur get back home.  <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EcoQuest">EcoQuest</a> tried to push kids to discover the
wonder, the grandeur, and ultimately the inter-dependence and fragility
of our ecosystem using some of the best elements of the adventure game
genre, openly encouraging exploration and curiosity and learning.  You
certainly don't see such &quot;liberal propaganda&quot; on today's game store
shelves...</p>

<p>Particularly emblematic to me of the entire genre of edutainment is the
<a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Brain">Dr. Brain franchise</a>. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2" name="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The first two games, <em>The Castle of Dr. Brain</em> and <em>The Island of Dr.
Brain</em>, were set up as tests, an ordered series of puzzles focused on
logic and math, with a pervading sense of fun and an atmosphere of the
bizarre meets the arcane.  Dr. Brain himself, who teased you to complete
his puzzles so that you might be proven a worthy assistant, spun the
classic &quot;mad scientist&quot; stereotype and made it cool.  Who doesn't want a
castle full of wonders and a personal island full of amazement?  As a
young boy I was excited every time that I managed to beat the next of
Dr. Brain's puzzles, getting closer to earning his esteem.  His puzzles
served as my first introduction to things as diverse as the Tower of
Hanoi problem to simple programming and logic gates.  More than any
other influence, I think the first two Dr. Brain games very much
cemented my interest in programming, showing how much of the basic
skills I had already internalized and helping me to internalize those
basic skills I had yet to master.</p>
<p>You will still find Dr. Brain titles on the shelves, but the disparity
with the first two is palpable.  I shouldn't have to explain the
disappointment I felt with <em>The Lost Mind</em> and I haven't bothered to try
later games, the boxes tell me all I need to know in how far the games
are from the ones that I spent so many hours mastering.  <em>The Lost Mind
of Dr. Brain</em> traded the sequence of increasingly difficult logic
puzzles for an unordered set of mini-games.  <em>The Lost Mind</em> traded all
of the atmosphere and most of the plot, what little there was, of <em>The
Castle</em> and <em>The Island</em> for a mediocre excuse for mini-games and a
worse excuse for mini-game grinding.  It was fun, but it wasn't the
driving test that the previous games had been.  After a while it got set
down and forgotten.  But it was easier to build and even easier to
continue to &quot;franchise&quot;, even if it failed to learn any of the lessons
of what made the first two games fun.  Eventually Dr. Brain was given a
make-over as a &quot;hipper&quot; young guy and the franchise entirely lost the
mad scientist appeal and aesthetic...</p>

<p>That's most of what you see left on the store shelves where educational
games are: franchises.  What's left are cookie-cutter clones of proven
recipes with proven characters.  Edutainment is a dead art form, and
educational games a shameful shell of what once filled the shelves.  If
game developers have failed to learn the lessons of gaming history and
fail to remember and value the classics of gaming, game developers
should feel especially damned for forgetting the land of edutainment.</p>
<p>Even given the irony of ignoring lessons from games <em>about</em> teaching,
it's easy to see that edutainment was always a bastard step-child of
games development, even in the &quot;good old days&quot;, but there was money
there and it was a place for a good developer to make some cash until
the next original project to work on.  Having cut his teeth on Dr.
Brain, lead developer Corey Cole went on to create Sierra's seminal
<em>Quest for Glory</em> series.  Perhaps the greatest of edutainment
developers, seminal edutainment developer MECC, began as a pseudo-agency
of the State of Minnesota, and maybe that's the sign that edutainment
wasn't sustainable.  MECC's later owners tried to capitalize on MECC's
early success but were largely unable to recreate the fun of the
originals in attempting to better franchise the company's products.</p>
<p>It might be interesting to create a list of &quot;The Classics of
Edutainment&quot; and introduce them to today's developers.  In lieu of a
formal list I'd be happy to suggest the aforementioned titles as
interesting starting points.  I'm inclined to replay them myself.</p>
