<p>I get a lot of flack at my lazy native pronunciation of Louisville.  (If you don't what I'm talking about you can generally find a sportscaster that finds great national coverage-worthy humor in asking &quot;Am I pronouncing that right?&quot; a few times, particularly during national Derby coverage in May.)  So, I feel vindicated in finding great humor in the fact that the place spelled Puyallup is pronounced more like &quot;Pee-wollop&quot;.</p>
