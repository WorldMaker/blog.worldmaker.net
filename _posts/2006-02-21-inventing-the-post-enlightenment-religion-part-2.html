title: Inventing the Post-Enlightenment Religion Part 2
---
<p>While playing with this topic I was struck again by an observation I have several times earlier made.  Basically, there is a modern Post-Enlightenment religion, but we often don't recognize it as such: the modern American corporate environment.  It isn't all that hard to hear some company name spoken in the reverent tones of someone trying not to anger the gods.  Then there is the huge world of Corporate soothe-speak, with Psalms on "motivational" posters and coffee cups.  Visit most HR departments and you'll find many of the most indoctrinated, as they are the front line for proselytizing.  I among many tend to seek my own solace amongst the anti-prophets (Douglas Adams, Scott Adams, Demotivations, Mike Judge).  I could go through my notes on how this culture fulfills all of the typical requirements of a religion, but I'll save that as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Well, I've been distracted by Wikipedia and lost my original train of thought...</p>
