title: 'The Laundry RPG: Session 1 and Fun With Office Supplies'
---

<p>On Wednesday I took on my first big &quot;real&quot; attempt at game mastering. The group I've been playing with had gotten a bit tired with its long-running D&amp;D game and in order to mix things up I agreed to take on the GM mantle for a while and try running some adventures from the files of <em>The Laundry</em>. I'm a fan of Charles Stross' series, and I felt it would be quite fun for a series of one-off RPG sessions. My players don't have any familiarity with the books nor do they seem to have much other experience with the Cthulu mythos... I take it as an interesting challenge to keep things interesting and maybe introduce them to crazy new things.</p>
<p>Session 1 started with the obligatory character creation. I spent a bit too much time in an office supply store picking up the preparations I wanted. I wanted to be a prepared GM and in weeks before had already picked up extra polyhedral randomization devices and a battle map. Now, I may like office supplies a bit too much, but it also seemed quite fitting for the setting. (As I've told my players, <em>The Laundry RPG</em> can be thought of as <em>Call of Cthulu</em> meets <em>The IT Crowd</em>.)</p>

<p>The biggest usage of the office supplies I purchased was these character packs. Plain manilla folder with a personnel record (character sheet) and a name tag, and a paper clip to bind them. The key piece that really sells this for me, though, and the thing I spent the most time figuring out was the &quot;Paper Clip&quot; acquisition form:</p>

<p>Certainly, none of my player's have read <em>The Fuller Memorandum</em> yet, but the threat of a paper clip audit and dealing with frightening-sounding Auditors I think came across well nonetheless. Making the players' characters sign a carbon copy form to acknowledge they indeed received one Paper Clip for the purposes of this personnel record certainly seemed to get the wacky, but maybe frightening bureaucracy thing across.</p>
<p>If I'm smart there will be a good payoff of dealing with the Auditors in some mission down the line. Unfortunately I don't have any plans for something like that: I'm still working from the point of view of a sequence of one-offs until the players or I get bored with the game. If I was planning for an &quot;actual&quot; campaign that would be something I would definitely work on. I do have crazy ideas if things start to become a campaign... <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>After character creation we ran through the opening &quot;linear railroading tutorial&quot; training in Dunwich. My players and their characters all failed their Cthulu Mythos rolls and also seemed too interested in the game to &quot;cheat&quot; and search the internet for clues. The interesting reveals, I think, still wait for next session.</p>

(The mysteerious (wiggle fingers) Black Chamber is uninteresting to me for roleplaying.) The idea I've come up with is a video game company that survived the gaming crash of the 80s by becoming a government sub-contractor and ending up with some of the projects where even Residual Human Resources aren't expendable enough so a lowest bid contractor with the proper security clearances is the name of the game...</td></tr>
