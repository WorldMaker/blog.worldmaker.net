title: The Louisville Cardinal fights for Liberalism
---
<p>Story discovered in the school's official student newspaper: <a href="http://www.louisvillecardinal.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/02/15/4212aeb3f003b?in_archive=1">BDSM beats all for improving intimacy</a>.  The headline and its bad pun brought an immediate laugh from me when I saw it hanging from the back of the seat at the basketball game.</p>

<p>Truthfully, sex articles are more interesting than much of the stuff the Cardinal prints, and a couple of my friends agreed that maybe we should start reading the Cardinal again.  Also interesting is the fact that the byline shows that this writer (she also wrote an article on Louisville's porn store culture) is a Women's Studies major, which is the third major "Conservative" degree (people studying it, PoliSci, or Engineering at Louisville all seem biased towards Conservatism).</p>

<p>(On the other hand, if Women's Studies meant what most guys jokingly hope it means, I'm sure it would be a very liberal degree program.)</p>
