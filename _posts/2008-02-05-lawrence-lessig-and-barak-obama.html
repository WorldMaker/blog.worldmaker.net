title: Lawrence Lessig and Barak Obama
---
<p>Lawrence Lessig, someone that I've come to trust as a fighter for decency and intelligence, put together a <a class="reference external" href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/20_minutes_or_so_on_why_i_am_4.html">20 minute persuasive video on why he supports Obama</a>.  It's worth a watch.  (Lawrence Lessig has been Obama's adviser on technology-related issues, by the way.)</p>
<p>Lessig posted a little bit later a YouTube <a class="reference external" href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/it_means_something_important.html">music video of Obama's Yes, We Can speech</a>.  Also worth a watch.</p>
<p>I haven't spent much time forming an opinion for the primary as Kentucky doesn't have much of a voice in the weird caucus system that we see today.  I do find myself leaning towards Obama over Clinton, particularly because of his involvement with Lawrence Lessig.</p>
