<div class="admonition-march-s-topic admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">March's Topic</p>
<p class="last">Can and do games exhibit authorial intent, as might a book?</p>
</div>
<p>Auteur theory, in films at least, suggests that a &quot;creative visionary&quot;
can truly lead a team project and have an authorial influence on all, or
nearly all, aspects of the project. Some people don't believe that an
auteur can truly lead a creative vision across a project, particularly
because a modern Hollywood film consists of work contributed by hundreds
of people, many of whom never work directly with each other.</p>
<p>I certainly am a believer of a broader view of Auteurism. I certainly
think there are Auteur directors that definitely leave an indelible mark
of themselves upon the screen. But I also think that the definition of
an auteur, of someone with an authorial impact on a film, expands to
fill many of the creative roles in a film. At one point I had my film
collection broken down by the Directors, Writers, Cinematographers and
even Actors that I think bring something more to a film, and can elevate
a film to greatness.  The idea that these individuals leave indelible
marks on a film's DNA, and to me that is <em>a</em> definition for &quot;authorial&quot;.</p>
<p>I watch a lot of DVD special features. It's a habit of mine to try to
watch most of the non-commentary special features on each DVD of mine.
I also realize that it can be something of a rare habit, as not a lot of
people care for special features.  One thing that I have noticed in my
special feature watching is something that should be practically common
sense: good auteurs find talented people to work for them.  Delving into
special features you will find auteurs' love letters to the editors,
costume designers, cinematographers, set designers, and what have you
that they've spent years building a rapport with. Tarantino's <em>Death
Proof</em> is almost entirely an ode to awesome stunt people that still do
most of what they do in camera and not in post-production trickery or CG
fakery.</p>
<p>I absolutely think that there are important skills there in talented
people finding other talented people and then herding those talented
cats into amazing circuses of wonder. I think that vision can come
through, and is without a doubt &quot;authorial&quot; in nature, that most
talented auteurs have certainly deconstructed their own work and
reconstructed it several times over the course of the film's creation. I
think a central vision, a central understanding of a film, can and does
permeate a film from an auteur.  There is a qualitative difference
between a film that &quot;knows what it wants to be when it grows up&quot; and one
that has to find itself on the way. There is a qualitative difference
between a film produced by talented people that love what they are doing
and who they are working for and with and a film created as industrial
product.</p>
<p>One other thing that I noticed was that some of my favorite films were
convergences of those I classed auteurs. One quick example is
<em>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</em>, which is directed by George Clooney,
adapted from the book by Charlie Kaufman, and Sam Rockwell stars.  All
three men add something to production, and the final product would have
been something much lesser without the various visionary capabilities of
its auteurs. I absolutely believe that auteur vision can be additive, at
least under the right circumstances. Even books can have surprisingly
wonderful results when multiple authors collaborate. (One quick example
to mind is Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's <em>Good Omens</em>.) A team
project is not necessarily doomed to being an assembly line without a
real vision for the product being made.</p>
<p>I include such a long preface to make it perhaps easier to swallow when
I declare: the Game Auteur is real and she continues to exist. At least
in my reckoning of it. I'll describe what I think an Auteur in gaming
is, and then touch upon what I think the future of gaming auteurs is.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-golden-era-of-auteurs">
<h1>A Golden Era of Auteurs</h1>
<p>I am one of the very few that talks about upcoming games in the language
of auteur theory; my game watching talk is nearly as peppered with
designers and production companies as my talk can be when talking about
films or television. I can switch gears from talking about the next
upcoming Coen Brothers film (<em>A Serious Man</em>) to the next upcoming Tim
Schafer game (<em>Br√ºtal Legend</em>) without skipping a beat, and perhaps
completely confounding whomever I'm talking to in the process. There are
auteurs working in video games today, and you probably just need to hear
me ramble on about the many people that I follow to get a sense of that.</p>
<p>A lot of that comes from the fact that I was, perhaps, raised in what
might be, under the golden miasma of nostalgia at least, a Golden Era
for auteurs in gaming. I, of course, refer to the era when LucasArts and
Sierra went head to head building amazing adventure games. It's not easy
to speak of either company's most classic adventure games without
referring directly to the auteurs that made them what they were. To call
them anything but auteurs is insincere or perhaps insulting. The team
sizes of the later era of graphic adventure games certainly are perhaps
small by today's massive sizes for games developments, but some of them
certainly weren't exactly small either. But so many of their visions
tied together all the disparate elements that made up the games that
they worked on, all the while adding the touches that made the games
have a good chunk of their own personalities. I don't know how you could
play across a good swath of Sierra's vasty adventure game catalog and
not feel like you've gotten to know a little bit about, at the very
least, Roberta Williams. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>As you can with film auteurs, within the classic LucasArts and Sierra
dynasties you could see the ebb and flow of creative talent across the
projects; as new auteurs apprenticed with experienced ones <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id2">[2]</a> and as
creative talents would converge on shared project visions, only to
diverge again for their next projects.</p>
<p>To this day, I still perk up at the mention of quite a few of the
creative names from that bygone era. As best I can I follow the news and
patronize <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id3">[3]</a> the many companies where the auteurs fled during the
creative diaspora. Examples include Telltale, Double Fine, Hothead,
August Moon, and many others.</p>
<p>Although to some extent they have almost been criminally forgotten or
ignored by today's game industry. As a fan, I have a hard time
understanding why some of the auteurs that I love in gaming have had
such hard times funding their own games, having proved themselves in the
past. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id4">[4]</a> At the very least, I can't believe that Vivendi started
not one, but two Leisure Suit Larry games without asking Al Lowe for
design input, if not leadership. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id5">[5]</a></p>
<p>With respect to some of the current state of things, the grand mastery
of classic LucasArts and Sierra over the creative sphere of game design,
certainly seems like a golden era. Those that even acknowledge that era
tend to pessimistically wonder if we may ever see anything like that
again. I think it was a brilliant period in gaming, but I'm certainly
hopeful for more and greater things to come with regards to game
companies encouraging creative talent, particularly auteurs, to flourish
and grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-hopefully-brighter-future">
<h1>A Hopefully Brighter Future</h1>
<p>In fact, I think we are slowly returning to a place where we, as
creators and/or players, can recognize the brilliant people among us and
around us building great games, and putting a bit of themselves into
those games. First of all, there are small companies fighting to do
creative things with games, and doing what they can to nurture those
creative visionaries that they find.</p>
<p>These companies need to slowly work towards bettering the business
practices of the industry. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id6">[6]</a> Perhaps more importantly, I think that
the gaming audience needs to start growing up and better recognizing the
talent before them. Of the audience, I think we are slowly getting to
that point. Many have commented that we seem to be near the edge where
incremental changes to graphics technology alone will no longer sustain
game purchases. I'm hopeful that game audiences will also slowly catch
up to some discernment of game mechanics, as well. Asking for more than
just the simple pleasure system addictions that are most easily met by
match-3 games or other such grinds, and slowly filtering towards
entertainment that might exercise other elements of our complex
emotional systems. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Of all the companies that might help bring about that future, the
surprise &quot;dark horse&quot; may in fact be mega-publisher EA. EA was founded
on promoting auteurs in game development, intentionally choosing a name
reminiscent of Hollywood studio United Artists. Along the way as games
became bigger and more complex, EA certainly lost sight of that. EA got
stuck somewhere in the trap of easy, industrialized and commoditized
games. It certainly seems that today's EA has slowly come back to
grasping that not all games can be commoditized, and that some require
creative risk. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id8">[8]</a></p>
<p>I'm not saying that EA is necessarily the gaming world's savior, just
yet. But I do think that creative direction in video gaming needs all
the allies that it can get and that parts of EA have shown at least a
few small sparks towards getting it.  What I am saying is that, if in
this economy it is EA, who've have been somewhat demonized in recent
years for sticking to commodities, that seems to be getting it: there
may be hope for the rest of us.</p>

Hollywood several decades of major labor disputes to handle, seems at
best naive. The fact that Hollywood's unions already have tentacles
reaching towards the game industry doesn't necessarily help either.
