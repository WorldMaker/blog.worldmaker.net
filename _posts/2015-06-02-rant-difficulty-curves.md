I've ragequit from *Dragon Age: Inquisition* DLC *Jaws of Haakon* twice now.
At this point on this character I've completed nearly everything that is possible
to complete, and the Quest Log reflects this. Of the main campaign, only a single
side quest dragon is left to defeat (its own source of ragequits, prior to the
DLC). Within the DLC itself I've completed as much of the side quests as I've
been able, leaving primarily a final irritating fade rift at the current level
of my character. The character is at Level 25 of experience points, which is about
as high as I can easily get, from all of the existing content in the game. I
suppose I could try to grind higher, but there's an interesting catch-22: the
exponential nature of the levels makes it increasingly slow to level up, and the
"save the world" nature of the game's story resolves in *less* content and *fewer*
spawns to grind against...

So I've followed the story along to **a** boss fight.
(Supposedly this isn't even *the* boss fight, as walkthroughs lead me to believe
there are a few more chapters to the DLC, but I'm trying not to spoil them, so
I'm unsure if what remains is all denouement or if there is indeed tougher
fights to follow.) I'm at-level with this fight and completely **frustrated**
by it: there's a few mechanics too many in play and not enough breather space
for me to not end up in a stressed out, angry ragequit.

The absolute kicker here is that I'm on a difficulty level named *Casual*. I get
that boss fights are "supposed" to be hard, but I'm not here for hard, I already
told the game that I'm pretty "Casual". I want to feel like a bad ass sorceror
that wins fights easily so I can move on to the next part of the story.

Admittedly, yes, I'm terrible at RPGs, but a key factor here is that I don't
have any particular desire to get better. I'm not that kind of player. I'm not
excited by how intricately or not you've modelled weaponry and armor. I'm just
not into your baroquely balanced variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors and the magic
game of numbers whizzing past in your "combat". All combat is grind to me.

I'm here for the story. You know, that part of the game you pay writers good
salaries for and voice actresses to breathe life into? The part you've got all
of those expensive cinematics built for?

Where's my "Skip This Annoying Combat Button" these days?

Press X to Skip Combat
======================

We've had this argument a lot over the years. It gets strangely heated,
because certainly there are plenty of players that love the combat and
figuring out complex systems of "combat interactions" and many of those
players seem to take it personally that some of us just want to skip
ahead sometimes (not even all the time, really).

The big thing, as Jennifer Hepler pointed out well (and was subsequently
blown well out of proportion by a violent, vocal group of jerks) in [a 
previous furor on this subject](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-16-fan-harassed-writer-jennifer-hepler-leaves-bioware):
What we're mostly asking for here is parity. Every single game I can
think of where I'd really like to skip an individual boss fight or mini-boss
fight has a button available to skip lines of dialogue or entire
conversations entirely. Players can willingly skip the parts of games
I'm there to see, so why can't I skip the parts of games that they're there
to see?

The Argument of "History"
-------------------------

An argument that shows up a lot is, "Earlier games were even tougher.
Retro games didn't have difficulty settings, much less the easy cakewalks
today's games have."

This is *partly* true, but:

1. So What? Grandpa used to have to haul twelve textbooks on his back as
   he sled uphill in the snow both ways to and from school every day in
   the endless winter of his childhood. I don't want to have to do that
   either.
2. Many of those retro classics people are still fond of provided very
   useful "cheat codes" that could be used to this purpose to make
   things a tiny bit easier. Cheat codes were once a magic sort of
   hidden puzzle game that yielded riches to different sorts of players.
   Cheat codes have all but vanished these days with "achievement systems"
   the modern norm.
3. I have my own counter-example from history: I still recall with great
   fondness how apolegetic the *Full Throttle* manual was that not
   everyone might like it's few action sequences/combat scenes and it
   handily provided a shortcut key to bypass a scene as if you had won
   the action.

There is a history for "Skip Combat Buttons"; that these people are
ignorant of it is unsurprising. I beat Max Payne 1 and 2 with cheat
codes because I wanted to know how the story twisted and to see the
fantastic level design. So far as I know, Max Payne 3 has no cheat
codes so I've barely seen past the opening of the game. (Yes, I'm
terrible at FPSes, too.)

The Argument of "Experience Cheapening"
---------------------------------------

I fear that some of this comes from the stigmatizing name of "cheat
codes", itself a historic relic. There are many things a person may want
from an experience. What "cheats" an experience for one person may enrich
the experience for others. I'm a fan of stories and (hopefully unsurprising
from my blog address) instances of world building. As I said above
combat is often a requisite impediment between me and the cool experiences
I want to have.

It's particularly fascinating that a single [Bartle group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test)
has grown to dominate this particular conversation. The modern consoles
all provide some aspect of Achievements and these things seem to mandate
a very hard line "no cheating" world. It makes it harder to discuss things
like what "babies" we as gamers lost when the cheat codes bath water
was thrown out. It makes it tougher to discuss things like "sometimes combat
skips" when one of the first things out of someone's mouth is, "but that
means my useless digital trophy loses some of its shine if I know someone
didn't put in as much work as me".

To be fair, difficulty levels account for *some* of this spectrum. (As I
point out, I'm still hitting cases where difficulty levels still don't
quite account for *me*, at least.) Also, the ability to "laser target"
multiple levels of Achievements means that it can be possible to provide
accomodations to the hard core achievers ("Do all the game again, this 
time on Super Incredibly Difficult Nightmare Mode"; no thanks, but
*congratulations* to those with such stamina).

I also get the argument that ludogically it follows that "tough moments"
in a story might best be served with "tough combats" that reflect such. I
think the issue here is that the game can be tough without beating me
over the head with how tough it is. It's that point where stress/anxiety
meets frustration and becomes **ragequit** that I'm particularly looking
to mitigate. There's certainly room for a game to maybe not make it easy to
skip a combat, but after you've spent thirty minutes on this, wiped five times,
and shouted a half-dozen obscenities at the console's microphone maybe
your game could consider that you've gotten the point across?

The Argument of "Willpower"
---------------------------

This is the strange flipside of the "cheapening"/"cheating" code: if
skipping combat is "cheating" (it's not; hopefully explained above), and
if skipping combat is available, then everyone will just skip combat so
we can't make skipping combat available. Everything about this argument,
from its assumptions to its bizarre sense of tautological continuity makes
me upset.

If you are going to skip combat, you are going to skip combat. There's
probably something else that interests you in the game you'd rather be
doing. If the combat isn't that interesting that even those people that
profess to love it, want all the achievables possible from it, and yet
still seem to think they'd skip it if the option was available: maybe they
don't love the combat so much as they seem to profess that they think
they do?

The WTF Difficulty Graph of Bungie's *Destiny*
==============================================

A final tangent here, but I got talked into trying *Destiny* a bit more
now that it's two first Expansion Packs are out. The second Expansion
Pack supposedly "smoothed" the grinding curve of the game, but I think
only highlights how weird its difficulty "curve" has always been.

I've had a mostly hate/hate relationship with Destiny's difficulty
noise wave. It's particularly interesting how it added RPG elements
which should have *smoothed* the difficulty curve and instead seems to
only add mayhem, at least from my perspective. My perspective: I am
not great at an FPS. I consider myself a useful "backup singer" in an FPS.
In a co-op scenario I'm decent at contributing (a smaller amount) to the
overall kill count and doing useful things like providing a distraction
or running for the hills to avoid a team wipe, then trying to resurrect
fallen comrades whom can get back to the main amount of killing.

It should be clear already why the majority of my Destiny time is spent
in "Strikes", the auto-matchmaking co-op levels. In my opinion there
clearly are not enough Strikes in the game and I do not understand why
every "Story" mission is not a Strike. Why can't I get auto-matchmaking
for the Story missions?

It is of course the difficulty wave of the Story missions that most
frustrates me. I'm not great solo, and the RPG-esque levelling seems to
indicate that maybe I can grind my way out of a situation, but I've
faced Story missions at as much as six levels higher and still hit
ragequit walls. (Solo, I really, really hate Destiny's "Darkness Zones"
that restrict respawns and checkpoints.) It says a lot to me that
Destiny's story missions don't have a difficulty level easier than
"Normal".

Cycling back to the reason I returned to Destiny after a ragequit
uninstall months back, I've had long discussions about my feelings of
Destiny's attempt to unite RPG-esque levels and equipment. I think it
is both the source of Destiny's most interesting attempts at
originality and also the source of most of its woes. XP in MMOs is
predictable: levels have a linear scale, or more commonly an exponentional
scale (level two is one and half times as hard to achieve as level one
and so forth). Destiny's equipment drops make the "Light Level" entirely
unpredictable.

Case in point being the crazy lottery I won the other day. I had spent a
couple weeks grinding Strikes for currency to buy Legendary equipment.
I managed to get two of the five pieces this way in a fairly linear grind.
(Both pieces cost the same, but the Strikes themselves can vary in effort
required due to team constitution, luck, and sometimes getting to play
cleanup and arriving into the Strike just in time to deliver the final
blow of its final boss, which kindly counts as beating the strike.)

Then from all the grinding of Strikes I decrypted enough Engrams (lotto
drops) to up my reputation with my local Crypto-Archealogist (sure) to
Level 5. Hitting a new level resulted in the Crypto-Archealogist Association
to snail mail me a few more lotto drops (er, Engrams) to have decrypted
by the Crypto-Archealogist across from the mailbox (like you do). To my
surprise the decrypted gear just happened to be the three remaining
Legendary armor pieces I needed. This of course instantly jumped me, with
one mail package four Light Levels (28 to 32).

It's certainly possible this sort of serendipity is intentional, and it is
definitely probable this sort of serendipity is from the lotto drop tweaks
that had been pushed out that made a bunch of people tell me to give the
game another try. That said, it's clearly *weird* from an intentional systems
design standpoint. (Ignoring even the weird facts that some lotto drops are instant
opened and the rest have the strange extra dance that you take them to a
shopkeeper *with a reputation system* that rewards random slot machine pulls
with more random slot machine pulls. Ugh, dopamine hacking is doing terrible
things to video games...) In other RPG games I've *wished* that someone could
just mail me four levels so I could do something less grindy. In Destiny I got
four levels mailed to me and was weirdly disappointed that I probably wouldn't
need to grind Strikes as much, which is just about the only thing I've been
doing in Destiny. (Potentially leading to ragequit's sibling the boredquit...)

I could probably use a buddy to help me clear the story missions left on my
map. I would probably be interested in finding a raid group. My friends that
play Destiny are scattered across the other platforms (360 and PS3/4)...
Bringing things a bit more full circle, I cannot even suggest a Skip Combat
button because it violates the implicit rules of thumb above: Destiny's
dialogue is also unskippable and its story a paltry painted matte painting
backdrop to the combat. In that I will grant Destiny is an okay, but weird
exception to my desire to see more "Skip Combat Buttons" in games.
