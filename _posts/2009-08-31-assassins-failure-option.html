title: 'Assassins: Failure is an Option'
---
<p><em>Assassins!</em> is an interesting game because a goal of it is to keep the
game generic enough that it can run a good number of variants, and there
are lots of lots of variants in the wild to try to appease. Today I did
some important debugging and then added a few new options based upon
early feedback.</p>
<p>In any game there is a fun tension between the mechanics and the
dynamics <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> and I want to make sure that in Assassins the dynamics are
open enough for interpretation under a number of variations. The tools
at hand are the mechanics and intelligent flexibility isn't exactly in
the realm of contemporary programming. The obvious answer is: give a
person options. That solution brings in its own problems: complexity
management. More options means more headaches for potential players.
Emergent complexity <em>is</em> dynamics, but you want controlled doses and you
want to keep the learning curve manageable.</p>
<p>So today's new feature set is all about opening parts of the game back
up to cheaters. That's not exactly the intent of it, but that will be
the outcome in some scenarios (but that is what moderators are for). The
actual intent is about opening up a tiny bit more of the game for
moderator control, and as much as possible making the moderator aware of
the (exploitable) trade-offs. All the while keeping the complexity from
making a moderator's job harder.</p>
<p>The initial sketch I did late in the afternoon involved four new check
box options. If you look at the actual updated page you will see only
two of those four planned check boxes. I realized that in making one
previously implicit, existing rule explicitly defined and documented
that I saved myself two check boxes and additional combinatorial
complexity (quadruple the total choices). Hooray! This is just the sort
of solution that a programmer enjoys finding.</p>
<p>In some Assassins games you can't guarantee the synchronization of
contract completion reports: players may be disconnected from web (or
SMS) opportunities to register completed contracts. In a slow game this
can be mitigated by telling players to kindly take their proper turns
(with a little bit of moderator intervention when necessary). In a
faster game players don't have time for every contract to be inputted in
order and need to be as flexible as possible.</p>
<p>My original thought was to add options to control the ability for
eliminated players to finish completing contracts (and while I was at
it, the transverse: contracts to be completed on eliminated players).
That leads directly to the need to stop contracts from auto-failing.</p>
<p>It turns out that I already made a design decision that simplified
matters. I probably even briefly considered this scenario when I made
it. Re-reading the code it turns out that there weren't any checks for
eliminated players: active contracts are active. This is a simple
solution, but it works: contract completion should be an atomic event
and when contract failure works correctly there shouldn't be any
contracts remaining for or upon eliminated players. Or, in the updated
version of the code: if contract failure happens there won't be any
contracts remaining for or upon eliminated players. Four options for the
price of two. Also, free zombies (under moderator control, of course).</p>
<p>So now game moderators have control of &quot;failure&quot;. Failure now, is
literally an option (well, two in fact). I think some people will rest
assured that failure is an option and that contracts fail all the time,
but they don't have to. (Also, there is totally double-meaning dripping
all over this paragraph, and I know it, but you may have to ask me to
explain, preferably over a beer.)</p>
<p>Was that the &quot;lazy&quot; solution? On the contrary, there was good thought
put into this. I have to trust my data store to have good transaction
semantics enough that I can leave my denormalization in its hands. This
just happens to look like a &quot;lazy&quot; solution. I'm fine with that. Lazy
can be a good friend to have, and Python is a language that encourages
the good aspects of lazy. (Albeit, not as much as my Haskell friends, but
I'm learning.)</p>
<p>I think something that tends to happen for a programmer is to focus too
hard on a problem and come up with some Rube Goldberg device that meets
the goals, but fails to address the complexity issues. Sometimes
simplicity is a hard to find quantity that provides a surprising amount
of potential dynamics for a cheap cost. I think there might be a lesson
there. Assassins has entirely been a project for me about controlled
simplicity, and it continues to be a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>...and there you have tonight's moment of programmer <em>fiero</em> brought to
you by too much caffeine and one really (really) long day.</p>
