<p>A Linguistic examination of why Conservatives have gained so much power in recent years.  Very insightful into the typical mindsets of Conservatives and Progressives and how to linguistically invoke them in people's minds.  Its not the full story or the full solution, due to its fairly narrow and specialized focus, but it offers great food for thought of several things that may in fact be key to any sort of a liberal, progressive victory.</p>
