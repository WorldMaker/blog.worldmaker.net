<p>Did a few things I had been meaning to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added a <a href="http://www.mythoi.com/node/4">status update</a> to Mythoi.com.  I still think the project has potential, but there's no snowball just yet.</li>
<li>Finally installed the Trackback module.</li>
<li>Finally re-added the <a href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/node/22">blockquotes.js</a> script to the template.  I missed it.</li>
<li>Did not re-add the <a href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/node/31">xfn.js</a> script, as I'm not so sure about the <a href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/node/33">icons</a> I had created.  Maybe I just got tired of them.  Maybe someone with better graphics wizardry should give it a shot.</li>
<li>Updated the "Friends" block.  Pentrant has a new address.</li>
<li>Updated <a href="/resume">my resume</a> with the Spring Semester dates.  Time to start sending out my resume, again.  I was chuckling that the coop department is angry that the University career services department is <strike>stupid</strike> understaffed and now many other co-opees are going to be sending out their own resumes like I've been doing the past couple semesters.</li>
</ul>
