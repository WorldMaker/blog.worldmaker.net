title: Recent and Planned Game Purchases
---
<p>I bought the New Super Mario Brothers the other day.  The game is just beautiful, with a lot of classic feel to it.  Between my brother and I we've opened up Worlds 1-5 already.</p>
<p>I signed up (via <a class="reference external" href="http://urulive.com">Uru Live</a>) for a month's GameTap trial.  GameTap will be the new home for Uru Live.  GameTap also has a distribution deal for Telltale's Sam &amp; Max episodes.  Between those two choice pieces of entertainment, GameTap finally had the power to sway me.  I'm thinking that I may again soon shut my City of Heroes/Villains account down and just pay for GameTap and possibly Puzzle Pirates again.  Interestingly, GameTap + Puzzle Pirates may be less per month than CoH/CoV, and a much better deal for entertainment choices.  GameTap is pretty endearing and I may in fact already be hooked.  A good part of the GameTap catalog I bought when the games were new, but there is the odd GameTap TV shows and there are some gems in the games catalog we've been finding that I hadn't previously tried like Mr. Driller.  My brother was quickly infatuated with Comix Zone.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that soon I'll break down and buy an XBox 360.  All of the interesting sounding games are Microsoft-made, though.  I'm actually more interested in the XBox Live Arcade games than any of the current third party games.  Carbonated Games (Microsoft internal casual games development) alone has some cool offerings.  I'm also debating whether or not I need a nice HDTV capable monitor to go along with an XBox 360...</p>
