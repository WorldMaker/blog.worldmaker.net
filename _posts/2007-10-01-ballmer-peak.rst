title: The Ballmer Peak
---
I've mentioned this before because I've experienced it personally and seen it in others, but `this comic on the Ballmer Peak <http://xkcd.com/323/>`_ is the first attempt I've seen to name it.  I do have extraordinary moments of programming clarity in that weird twilight between "buzzed" and "drunk".  It's also the only point where I have any sort of Geometry Wars skills at all (all of my achievements in the game having arrived when I was drunk).
