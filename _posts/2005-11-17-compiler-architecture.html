title: Compiler Architecture
---
<p>Microsoft's work in progress <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kangsu/archive/2005/11/16/493744.aspx">Pheonix</a> may have some interesting consequences in compiler architecture and design.  The possibilities of having a unified, plugin-able compiler architecture are pretty vast...  probably something that would be nice to have come thesis time, should I choose to explore somewhere in this area.  Not that I have any particular ideas in mind, just that I find compilers fascinating.</p>
