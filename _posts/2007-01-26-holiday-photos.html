<p>It's only taken me a month, but I finally uploaded the photos that I took over the holidays.  Probably not too incredible for anybody, but there are couple of cute shots in there of my family.  Ah, transience.  On the topic of transience:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Three shots of my Holiday Special beerrow, &quot;Holiday Stars&quot;.   I don't why, but these stupid artworks of bottle caps arranged to whim seem to speak to me a lot.  I've certainly had a problem with seeing each subtly different phase in my life as a disparate existence unto itself; born and reborn approximately every three months as I move again or I take different classes and deal with different problems and people.  The beerrows, and I think that's what I'm going refer to them regardless of shape, become sign pointers along the way.  I don't know what these &quot;art pieces&quot; say to those around me, but they say a lot to me of where I was and who I was when I made it.  I don't know, does art need rationalization?  Is arranging beer caps in amusing patterns, photographing them, then throwing them away, art?  I guess.</li>
<li>This is my 301st blog entry in Django.  Not exactly special in any sense, particularly because I've certainly written much more than that (thanks to the &quot;Great Website Crash&quot; a few years ago), but a further transient reminder of where I've been.</li>
</ul>
