<p>Agin Kwisaki was old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He had served the World Government for more than half his life and
sometimes wished he hadnÃ¢â¬â¢t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He still
hadnÃ¢â¬â¢t retired, after telling himself every year that now was the time to see
the World he had helped govern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course
there were perks that came with seniority, but right now he didnÃ¢â¬â¢t care for
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Elections were coming up, and
even though he had one won them time and again, something felt odd this time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The smell of politics had changed and Agin
wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t sure what that meant for him, an old geezer who had spent a lot of time
in office.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nova Sholaba smiled at the crowd, his crowd, and chuckled
to himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He raised his hands and
they cheered even louder than before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He lowered his hands and they silenced, waiting to hear what he had to
say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nova had to admit to himself that
it felt good to be up on the podium speaking.</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅFor too long have we let our animal cousins fear us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For too long we have abused Mother Earth!Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The crowd cheered, mixed of animal lovers of many types,
all appreciated a politician who could speak for them.</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅWe, the Human population of Earth must cease treating
Animals as pets and caged things for our own amusement, but as equals!Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>A lone voice hissed, Ã¢â¬ÅThey are inferior!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What are you talking about?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Nova sighed, there was always one who did not believe,
Ã¢â¬ÅSir, I am afraid you are in the wrong place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Security, you know how to handle this.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Nova let it slip his mind as he returned to moving the
crowd.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Excerpt from Introduction to World Politics:</i></p>

<p>The world has been peacefully governed for 150 years
without incidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The so-called World
Government, officially known as the United World Republic, has had little
incidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The strong UWR has already
begun colonization of the planet Mars and UWR Moonbase is full of UWR
astrologists . . .</p>

<hr />

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅNova Sholaba continues to gain votes in the race for
President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With me is current Cabinet
Major for President Vracharda, Agin Kwisaki to discuss this new entry into an
already tight race.Ã¢â¬Â<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Chrona Fejito, the
latest TalkPoli host, nodded to her guest.</p>

<p>Agin wiped sweat of his brow and nodded back. Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m glad to
be here,Ã¢â¬Â he lied, he couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t stand the sensationalism of TalkPoli, Ã¢â¬ÅShall we
begin?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Chrona Fejito smiled an almost noxious smile, her chiseled
face showing signs of Facial Rejuv, the hottest new therapy for those whoÃ¢â¬â¢ve
got to have <i>it</i> (whatever that was).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Ã¢â¬ÅOkay, what do you think about Nova Sholaba and his Doolittlism?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅTo tell you the truth, the guy seems like a nut to
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IÃ¢â¬â¢m not sure if heÃ¢â¬â¢s cut for
Politics.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Chrona grimaced slightly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Agin sighed, <i>she must be one of those Doolittlist nuts, better be
careful what I say</i>.</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅAs for Doolittlism, it does have its merits, but World
Gov. is already doing everything it can to conserve the animals.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What more does this Nova kid want?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Chrona frowned, Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬â¢ve got a call.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Hello?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>YouÃ¢â¬â¢re on TalkPoli Live!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Broadcasting from UriGen Studios.</i>Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>A male voice spoke over the Net and was displayed on a
monitor for Agin to watch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅMr.
Kwisaki, how can you say that when <b>your own reports</b> show an increase in
Species Death within the past forty-three years?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅSpecies Death is part of the natural order of things, we
cannot control it or impede it.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The male tensed, Ã¢â¬ÅYes, but not at a rate of almost a species
a day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most insect species are dead,
Mr. Kwisaki.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅThere have been times where Species Deaths have been very
high-- . . .Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The male interjected, Ã¢â¬ÅDuring Climate Changes and minor
Apocalypses.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬âBut, even so, some deaths were called for by the publicÃ¢â¬Â¦
such as the mosquito.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The male sighed, said, Ã¢â¬ÅYou are an egocentric pigÃ¢â¬Â¦ Long
Live Nova, Animals Have Rights Too!Ã¢â¬Â and abruptly hung up.</p>

<p><i>Excerpt from <u>The Doolittlist Manifesto</u> by Zuko
Sholaba:</i></p>

<p>Ã¢â¬Â¦The way we govern, the way we work, and everything about
us needs to change before we are fit to have another planetÃ¢â¬Â¦<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We must do the best we can with this
oneÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the game of Life, there are no
second chancesÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>

<hr />

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅYesterday, June 25<sup>th</sup>, 2932, the Doolittlist
Candidate Nova Sholaba was put into office by a landslide vote.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The way the polls were going; itÃ¢â¬â¢s not a big
surprise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>President Sholaba will be
sworn in today at 1500, but he has so far not revealed who will be on his
cabinetÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin Kwisaki turned off the television.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was tired and angry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He had always planned on going out of his
own volition, not pushed out by a new younger generation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He leaned back in his Recliner and let his
wallscreenÃ¢â¬â¢s screensaver rock him into a partial nap.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The screen flashed an Orange priority signal in the lower right-hand
corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Agin sighed, let his recliner
up and spoke to the screen, Ã¢â¬ÅSystem: Answer; audio onlyÃ¢â¬Â.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the screen appeared a larger than life
sized image of the newly elected President Sholaba.</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅCongratulations on your winÃ¢â¬Â¦ President.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Nova smiled warmly, Ã¢â¬ÅThank you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I would like to speak to you on something important.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The status-blip in the corner of the wall screen pulsated
from Orange to the Cyan of a Data Connection; the house computer system spoke
up, Ã¢â¬ÅPublic-key receivedÃ¢â¬Â¦ Sending System Public-KeyÃ¢â¬Â¦ Key SentÃ¢â¬Â¦ Switching to
Encrypted Data Line.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Once more the status-blip changed color, this time to the
reddish orange of an Encrypted line.</p>

<p>Agin sighed, Ã¢â¬ÅSo, what do you wish to talk about.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅI know that you think I am a nut, but I would like you to
be my Cabinet Major.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No one else
qualifies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Before you say no, let me
show you something.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin smiled to himself, happy to be wanted, Ã¢â¬ÅOkay, IÃ¢â¬â¢m
listening.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅMeet me at UriGen Headquarters in half and hour.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IÃ¢â¬â¢ll be waiting by the front door.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin frowned, Ã¢â¬ÅUriGen?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Excerpt from <u>30<sup>th</sup> Century Business</u>:</i></p>

<p>UriGen has been a wildcard in the field of
BiogeneticsÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They have been very open
on the kinds of research and work done at UriGen, but with sole profit gathered
in ventures such as NetvisionÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>many
experts arenÃ¢â¬â¢t sure exactly what UriGenÃ¢â¬â¢s long-term plans are, and are afraid
to find out.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m sure you have done your homework on me and my family,
Mr. Kwisaki,Ã¢â¬Â Nova asked mildly as they strolled into the lobby, Ã¢â¬ÅSo tell me,
what do you know of my mother?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin shrugged, Ã¢â¬ÅNot very much, she has kept her privacy
well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>HereÃ¢â¬â¢s what I know about Zuko
Sholaba; sheÃ¢â¬â¢s a divorced ex-scientist who used to work for Yatithokanta
Research Labs in Toronto before the place went under.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Her current employment is unknown, and how she raises money to
support her three children, Nova, Payfay, and Tiga Sholaba is also unknown.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Nova smiled, Ã¢â¬ÅVery good, IÃ¢â¬â¢m surprised you have found even
that much on the Net, your search engine must be superb.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin chuckled, Ã¢â¬ÅNot even the best search engine could have
gotten all of thatÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>not the way your
mother has vanished off the face of the net.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>No, I also had a friend who knew your mother at Yatithokanta.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅWell then, let me fill you in on some more of my motherÃ¢â¬â¢s
history:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My mother has worked in the
field of Biogenetics for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After her divorce and the failure of Yatithokanta she despaired.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, she had hope in her previous
project and wrote a book that was published only for a short period, net-only.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This book was titled Ã¢â¬ËThe Doolittlist
ManifestoÃ¢â¬â¢ and was picked up by a collection of esoteric people across the
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many of these were rich and very
interested in what my mother had to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>They financed UriGen and put her as President of the company.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each of those who had read the original book
was placed in her cabinet, the UriGen Council.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>From behind the scenes through Netvision and other methods the Council
and UriGen itself finished my motherÃ¢â¬â¢s original research and began pulling
string politically.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin paled, <i>why is he telling me all of this?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IsnÃ¢â¬â¢t he afraid I might let his secret
slip?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Is he just part of a mad
conspiracy to get the rich in power over the government?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<pÃ¢â¬ÅThe one thing that URW doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t have in its conservation
efforts is DARWIN.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin laughed, Ã¢â¬ÅCharles Darwin.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>HeÃ¢â¬â¢s dead.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Nova turned to the secretary behind the reception desk,
Ã¢â¬ÅTell my mother that we are on our way, and send for the elevator.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Then it was NovaÃ¢â¬â¢s turn to laugh, Ã¢â¬ÅNo, IÃ¢â¬â¢m not talking
about Charles Darwin, IÃ¢â¬â¢m talking about acronym DARWIN.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Let me show you.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Excerpt from TalkPoli Live!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Special Inauguration Episode:</i></p>

<p>C.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>FEJITO:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We are just a few hours away from the big
moment and boy am I excited!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is
the first UWR President to be well liked, and many are full behind President
SholabaÃ¢â¬â¢s reforms on Natural IssuesÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>

<hr />

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅMother, I would like you to meet Mr. Agin Kwisaki; Mr.
Kwisaki, this is my mother, Ms. Zuko Sholaba.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin bowed, Ã¢â¬ÅIt is a pleasure to meet you Ms. Sholaba.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ms. Sholaba, almost completely gray, yet still graceful of
movement, returned his bow with a curtsy, Ã¢â¬ÅThe pleasure is all mine, Mr.
Kwisaki.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is rare when I get to
entertain such a notable politician as you.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin smiled, Ã¢â¬ÅYou flatter me, but could you please explain
this so-called DARWIN?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ms. SholabaÃ¢â¬â¢s smile was disarming and much more <i>real</i>
than most, Ã¢â¬ÅDARWIN is something IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent most of my life on.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IÃ¢â¬â¢m afraid that it has changed so much over
time that the original meaning of the acronym at Yatithokanta has lost much of
its weight.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ms. Sholaba turned on a wallscreen at the far side of the
conference room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Agin had a hard time
decoding much of itÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it was full of
schematics and Genetic Code sequences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Ms. Sholaba sat down and motioned for Agin to do the same.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅPlease warn me if I start to go over your
headÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IÃ¢â¬â¢m used to entertaining people
with scientific backgrounds, and I do tend to ramble.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin nodded and Ms. Sholaba continued, Ã¢â¬ÅDARWIN is an idea
that people have played with for centuriesÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>ever since the 20<sup>th</sup>/21<sup>st</sup> centuries at the
latest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Imagine intelligent animals,
ones who can speak, think and interact on the same level we can.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅSo DARWIN is a biogenetic ability to increase the
intelligence of the remaining animal species?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ms. Sholaba shook her head, Ã¢â¬ÅNot entirely, though that is a
part of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Originally it was even
believed that it would be possible to do it completely in the genes, but as
DARWIN progressed, we found that we needed something more, hence the schematics.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In order to make it work we need modern
technology-- net tech to be specific.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The schematic you see here is off a very simple prototype model
developed here at UriGen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Known as
N.A.R.F. technology, the Ã¢â¬ËNeural Amplifier/Receptive FeedbackÃ¢â¬â¢ technology
generates an extra-somatic method of intelligence.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin frowned, Ã¢â¬ÅExtra-somatic method of intelligence?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ms Sholaba nodded, Ã¢â¬ÅBasically, the machine allows us to
have the mind workÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>outside of the
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It sounds weird, but it
works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Using the basic construction of
the system they can be created for almost any animal, and for multiple
purposes.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin was awed, Ã¢â¬ÅIncredibleÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>using this NARF tech you can increase the mental capacities of
anythingÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So then why is Biogen
necessary at all, if the NARF does everything you need?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How does NARF use net tech?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ms. Sholaba frowned, Ã¢â¬ÅBiogen is definitely necessary.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The animalÃ¢â¬â¢s mind must be adapted to be
receptive to NARF technology or it wonÃ¢â¬â¢t work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Since NARF is based on <i>human</i> neural patterns we have to make the
animals conform to <i>human</i> neural patterns.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅOkay.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅAs for net tech,Ã¢â¬Â Ms. Sholaba continued, Ã¢â¬ÅI bet that we
three are probably some of the sole people remaining without a DNC.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin frowned, Ã¢â¬ÅWhat does a Direct Neural Connection have to
do withÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>oh, so you use DNCs to plug
your NARF into an animalÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IsnÃ¢â¬â¢t that
against the law?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everything should have
a choice.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅNo, we donÃ¢â¬â¢t use DNCs, but we use something similar.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ever heard of a thing called a ENFG?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin shook his head.</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅElectro-Neural Field Generators were considered impossibleÃ¢â¬Â¦
the skull is too great a shield to allow for neural communication with an
outside system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That isnÃ¢â¬â¢t true.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>UriGen is the sole patent owner of ENFG
tech, and we have downplayed discovery to keep the tech from falling into the
wrong hands.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin frowned, Ã¢â¬ÅHow altruistic, why are you so worried about
that tech?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅImagine it, Mr. Kwisaki, with ENFG tech anyone can control
anyoneÃ¢â¬â¢s mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dangers of such tech
are unimaginableÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You could be forced
to live your worst fears, have your most secret secrets stolen from your mind,
or even be sent into a permanent vegetable state,Ã¢â¬Â Ms. SholabaÃ¢â¬â¢s voice held
little rancor.</p>

<p>Nova spoke up for the first time, Ã¢â¬ÅWhich is where I come
in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We must get a kind, gentle
government setup to keep these things out of the wrong hands.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We must get NARF and DARWIN publicly
approved, and we <b>must</b> do it slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We need your help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You have the
political clout and experience we need to get the ball rolling and get a
long-term political strategy working.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve already done the easy part, getting elected.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin chuckled to himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Ã¢â¬ÅCount me in, IÃ¢â¬â¢m interested in this whole odd business. One last
political war for me to fightÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>might as
well fight it in something that will change the world.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<hr />

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m Chrona Fejito, welcome back to our full day Ã¢â¬ËTalkPoli
Live! Special Inaugural EpisodeÃ¢â¬â¢.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>WeÃ¢â¬â¢re
live from World Square in Proru, Antarctica.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve just received word from UriGen Studios in California that
President Sholaba is within minutes of jÃ¢â¬â¢optering in.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<hr />

<p>For the second time that day Agin Kwisaki tried to remain
calm while traveling by the ultra fast jet Ã¢â¬Ëcopter, colloquially known as a
jump hopper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t like most
peoplesÃ¢â¬â¢ fear of the speed or height, but it was his own remembrances of the
time he had almost crashed in one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of
course, that was back when the AI net-face wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t as Ã¢â¬ËsmartÃ¢â¬â¢ as it is now, but
Agin still didnÃ¢â¬â¢t trust something so blasted stupid as a jump hopper.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all, how can you trust something that
a human isnÃ¢â¬â¢t fast enough to pilot, much less has to be controlled by an AI
system linked to one of worldÃ¢â¬â¢s biggest traffic jams, the net.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅPresident SholabaÃ¢â¬â¢s jump hopper is visible on the edge of
the horizon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As you can see, it is
slowing its speed enough to make a safe landing on the jump platform to the
west of the building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ceremony
should begin shortly.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Chrona made a cut-off motion with her hand and leaned back
in her chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅTell me again why we are
doing a full day of this?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>ChronaÃ¢â¬â¢s producer, T. L. Applegate, sighed, Ã¢â¬ÅBecause the
pay is good and because we plan on getting out of this show and onto something
better like Celeb Pie Hour or Cooking with Chrona.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Chrona laughed, her producer always knew what to say to
make her feel better, Ã¢â¬ÅAt least I can cook T.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>T faked a wince, Ã¢â¬ÅOh, come on Chrona, give me a breakÃ¢â¬Â¦<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>while on the subject, though, erÃ¢â¬Â¦ my cook is
on vacation and could youÃ¢â¬Â¦ you knowÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅCook for you?Ã¢â¬Â she asked him, Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢d love to T,Ã¢â¬Â she smiled
at him and he smiled back.</p>

<p>T glanced at the ceremonial stage, Ã¢â¬ÅI think they are about
to startÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On 3Ã¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â he counted the numbers
down on his hand before giving Chrona the signal to begin.</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅOnce more we are back live at World Square.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ceremony seems almost ready to begin and
we expect the President out at any moment with his full assembled cabinet,
which we still do not have any clue as to who will be on it.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>An announcer voice filled the square, projected from
multiple hidden speakers, Ã¢â¬ÅLadies and Gentleman, please be seated, we present
Candidate Sholaba, voted by the public, through the net and voting terminals,
of the United World, to be the next President.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>As per instructions Chrona filled the time that it would
take for the ceremonial opening of the grand doors with a political commentary,
Ã¢â¬ÅAlthough recognized by the public and referred by the public as President,
Nova Sholaba is not recognized by the government as President until after the
ceremony.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The doors were full open and the lower cabinet members
waltzed out to their seats on the far ends of the long table that stretched the
length of the stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Slowly the middle
cabinet members filtered in and took their seats as well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The announcer all the while reciting names.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The higher cabinet positions were brought
out with more fanfare and the announcer recited name and title.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Vice President was cheered to the third
remaining seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Eventually there were
two seats left at the middle of the table, one for the President himself, the
other for the Presidents first aide, the Cabinet Major.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The announcer announced, Ã¢â¬ÅCabinet Major--
Agin Kwisaki.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅWhat!Ã¢â¬Â shouted Chrona before remembering she was on
camera, Ã¢â¬ÅWell this has certainly been a surprise; the President has chosen
current chairholder Agin Kwisaki to remain as Cabinet Major.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IÃ¢â¬â¢m sure I speak for many when I wonder what
the reasoning is behind this move.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The announcer boomed, Ã¢â¬ÅCandidate Sholaba.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Many in the crowd cheered as Nova Sholaba, in the
ceremonial robes of state, regally walked down the stairs and took a seat in
the exact middle chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Chief
Justice Yis Arthro stepped up to the middle chair.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>He voiced, amplified by the speaker system, Ã¢â¬ÅCandidate Sholaba,
you have been voted by the peoples of the world to lead them in honor and
dignity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Do you accept this post and
all of the responsibilities that come with it?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅYes.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Chrona commented, Ã¢â¬ÅThe first question is a mere formality
added after Sighyu Howagu ran out of the ceremony because of stage-fright.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The Justice nodded and proceeded to the next question,
Ã¢â¬ÅYour chosen cabinet members are here by your side.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>These cabinet members shall advise you on matters of state, have
you chosen them well?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅYes.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The Justice continued, Ã¢â¬ÅThe Justice calls forth the Speaker
of the House.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>A Hologrammatic Display appeared with the features of the
current Speaker of the House.</p>

<p>The Justice turned to the display and asked, Ã¢â¬ÅHas Congress
reached a vote as to the suitability of the PresidentÃ¢â¬â¢s chosen cabinet?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅYes.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The Justice went on, Ã¢â¬ÅThen, as representative of the
combined houses until the Vice President is appointed, how does congress vote?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The Speaker bowed, Ã¢â¬ÅAlthough we do not know the logic
behind the choice of Cabinet Major for this Candidate, Congress agrees that
this Cabinet is suitable for the Candidate.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The display fizzled out and the Justice turned back to Nova
Sholaba, Ã¢â¬ÅYou must repeat the oath of office after me.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Chrona cut in on overdub for those too bored to listen to
the Presidential oath, Ã¢â¬ÅJustice Arthro now administers the oath of office.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The oath is a very basic oath that recounts
the goals of the UWR and the responsibilities of the President in particularÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>After the recitation was complete Justice Arthro smiled,
bowed, and then took his seat off stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>The announcer voiced, Ã¢â¬ÅMay we introduce President Sholaba, the 34<sup>th</sup>
President of the United World Republic.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Everyone in the audience cheered, many loudly.<span

<p>Ã¢â¬Â¦June 26<sup>th</sup>, 2932 was a big day in the history of
the worldÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It marked not only the
institution of the first President Sholaba, but it was also the day that Agin
Kwisaki, a political genius, joined the campaignÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>But most importantly, it was especially the day when history was
forever madeÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>

<hr />

<p>It was about 1350 Antarctica Unstandard Time and the
meeting was coming to a close, most points had been decided: the project
schedule, long term goals, and how this information was to be stored.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Agin was growing a bit tired after all of
the arguing between the much younger members who made up the rest of the
cabinet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Suddenly, what-was-his-name,
one of the lower members in the accounting group of members cried out, Ã¢â¬ÅThe
figures donÃ¢â¬â¢t work!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There isnÃ¢â¬â¢t enough
space in the budget for DARWIN and NARF if we keep all the current UWR
programs.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ayo Bunefe, Secretary of State, and a cabinet member Agin
was beginning to like, sighed, Ã¢â¬ÅWell, what can we get rid off?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Something nonessentialÃ¢â¬Â¦ but also something
that isnÃ¢â¬â¢t going to make a big public stirÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Someone from the Narcotics section of the cabinet yelled
out, Ã¢â¬ÅHow about drug awareness programs?Ã¢â¬Â causing a snigger to chorus through
the rest of the Narcotics cabinet members.</p>

<p>Kafash Ebili, Secretary of Space, looked up from his
datapad and gave an attention wanting cough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 

</span>All of the members of the cabinet turned towards him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He smiled and chuckled, Ã¢â¬ÅOkay, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve got a
riddle for youÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What takes lots of
budget space yearly, has been delayed ninety times already and the public has
already lost faith in?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Many of the cabinet members had blank stares, some broke
into small groups of conversation, and others chuckled silently to
themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Agin growled, Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m tired, I
want to get home, what are you hinting at?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Kafash smiled, Ã¢â¬ÅBoth the Martian and Moon terraforming
projects are ripe for putting on Ã¢â¬Ëindefinite holdÃ¢â¬â¢.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It wonÃ¢â¬â¢t be much missed by the public, and we can reinstate
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It makes sense, as well, because we
have publicly stated that we should deal with domestic matters first.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin shrugged, Ã¢â¬ÅWe would still like to have those programs
runningÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>for the futureÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅWhich is in centuries according to the current planÃ¢â¬Â¦<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However,Ã¢â¬Â Kafash interjected, Ã¢â¬Ågive us a
third of the current budget for R&amp;D to keep our scientists happy and
DARWIN/NARF can have the rest.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>A few of the lower cabinet members on the Space side of
things clapped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Accounting lower
member, whatever-his-goofy-name-was, smiled and said, Ã¢â¬ÅThatÃ¢â¬â¢s more than half a
billion dollars, more than enough!Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Excerpt from <u>Enemy Inside: The Struggles of
Doolittlist Politics</u>:</i></p>

<p>Ã¢â¬Â¦One of the things that was to make a huge impact on the course
of the history of Dolittlism wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t on the outside, but growing among the ranks
of the Doolittlist population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those
disenfranchised few remained silent through the first few years of the first
President SholabaÃ¢â¬â¢s presidency, and had it not been for his trusted cabinet
member Agin Kwisaki, those few would have destroyed everything that the
SholabaÃ¢â¬â¢s and UriGen had builtÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>

<hr />

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅCongratulations, Agin.Ã¢â¬Â Ayo Bunefe, the best man, patted
the groom at the flowery reception in the State Hall of the UWR.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅYou couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t have picked a finer wife for a
second, and late, marriage.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin beamed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ayo
turned to the bride and chuckled, Ã¢â¬ÅShould I call you Mrs. Kwisaki now?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m afraid that Zuko Kwisaki is just too much,Ã¢â¬Â the bride
chuckled, Ã¢â¬ÅAgin and I have to decided that I should just leave my name Zuko
Sholaba.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ayo smiled, Ã¢â¬ÅAny kids?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin shook his head, Ã¢â¬ÅBeing the step-father to the
President of the UWR is more than enough.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Kafash Ebili, who, although not portly, was not exactly
skinny either, was stuffing his face at the buffet, couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t help bursting into
the conversation, his mouth half full, Ã¢â¬ÅWhat does the public think?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Mrs. Sholaba laughed, Ã¢â¬ÅThey think what I tell them to
thinkÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IsnÃ¢â¬â¢t that right, Payfay, dear?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅMother!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You know
that I hate that name, my name is Chrona now.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Zuko gave one of those kids-these-days eye rolls and Kafash
about fell down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅYourÃ¢â¬Â¦ daughterÃ¢â¬Â¦ is
theÃ¢â¬Â¦ TalkPoli host??Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Zuko chuckled, Ã¢â¬ÅEven Agin, who has spent all these years in
Politics canÃ¢â¬â¢t believe some of the aces in my sleeve.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Nova, who had been standing silently by himself at the
periphery of the conversation smiled and added, Ã¢â¬ÅTiga should be preparing for
the next presidential electionsÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the
way, PÃ¢â¬â er, Chrona, whenÃ¢â¬â¢s the wedding?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>ZukoÃ¢â¬â¢s eyes bulged, Ã¢â¬ÅWedding?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Chrona sighed and dropped her head, Ã¢â¬ÅHis name is T. L.
Applegate, heÃ¢â¬â¢s my producer, and weÃ¢â¬â¢re getting married in eight months.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Zuko chuckled, Ã¢â¬ÅI guess IÃ¢â¬â¢ll have toÃ¢â¬Â¦ raise his
salary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, when were you expecting to
tell me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>IÃ¢â¬â¢ll have to do the planning,
of course.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<hr />

<p>Agin was completely tired and the honeymoon was yet to
come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This late into the fifth term and
final term Agin had a lot of work to finishÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He was thinking on some of this work as he walked quietly down the halls
of the UWR Ã¢â¬ÅTowerÃ¢â¬Â, where most of the public officials lived.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As he rounded a corner he stopped, thinking
he had heard a few voices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Though not
unusual for there to be talking in the Tower, he strained to hear out of
political habit.</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅI canÃ¢â¬â¢t believe what they are planning to doÃ¢â¬Â¦ IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent
five years not believing it, and now I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know what to think,Ã¢â¬Â the voice was
obviously a lower cabinet member, yet Agin did not recognize it.</p>

<p>A middle cabinet member, from Commerce Agin thought, spoke
up, Ã¢â¬ÅI say now is the time to strike, while they are still weak.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The lower member spoke again, Ã¢â¬ÅNo, letÃ¢â¬â¢s do it just as they
areÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>But, we need a name.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅI like animals as much as the next, but what the
Doolittlists plan isÃ¢â¬Â¦ sacrilegious,Ã¢â¬Â a third voice added, this time someone
from outside the cabinet, which scared Agin more than anything, Ã¢â¬ÅI say we use
the name Saviors of Eden.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>The first voice laughed, Ã¢â¬ÅI like it.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin paled and continued to his roomÃ¢â¬Â¦<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>quietly, and yet as quickly as he could
muster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Zuko was surprised when he shut
the door as quickly as he did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅWhatÃ¢â¬â¢s
the matter Agin?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin caught his breath and slid into the bed, Ã¢â¬ÅWe have
enemies, <i>The Saviors of Eden</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
heard them conspiringÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Ã¢â¬ÅCalm down, IÃ¢â¬â¢m sure weÃ¢â¬â¢ll have time to beat themÃ¢â¬Â¦<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>we just have to add it to the plan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These Edenites cannot stop us, merely slow
our plan.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Agin sighed, Ã¢â¬ÅBut they know our plan, and we donÃ¢â¬â¢t know
theirs.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p>Zuko smiled, Ã¢â¬ÅPlans are just pieces of paperÃ¢â¬Â¦<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>like laws, some of them are made to be
broken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>DonÃ¢â¬â¢t worry about it.Ã¢â¬Â</p>
