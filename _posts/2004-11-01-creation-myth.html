<blockquote>The best [colonization] proposals I see are the ones that
	have a good binding metaphor.  The metaphor provides a good
	story that can help to pull an early Colony together and can
	help a fledgling Colony through the possibly tough early years.
	--Senator R. Buckley, Joint Colonization Committee, Terran
	Government, Early Colonial Era</blockquote>

<p>The Starship <i>Ymir</i> was built and designed by the <u>Star
	Colonization Corporation</u> on behalf of the ReNorse
Consortium.  One of several early colonial groups, the <u>ReNorse
	Consortium</u> chartered a region of space they labeled
<u>Ginnungagap</u>.</p>

<p>StarCol was well known for its solid engineering work, and many of
its early colonization ships survived well after their original use.
For those interested, many of StarCol's ship designs and several of the
original ships can be viewed at the <u>Museum of Humanity's StarCol
	Expanse</u>.</p>

<p><i>Ymir</i> has particular interest because it did not survive far
beyond its initial voyage to Ginnungagap.  The rights to its design were
also bought on an exclusivity contract by ReNorse and so were held only
in a secure sector of StarCol's vaults that was apparently lost at some
point in StarCol's takeover by the <u>Terran Transportation
	Corporation</u>.</p>

<p>What little survives of the <i>Ymir</i> design has been construed
from the mythology and historical texts of the colony from the
Ginnungagap dating to before the colony's first Ragnarok event.  Due to
the very nature of the records most historians are skeptical as to the
validity of any claims that may be distilled from them.  For more on
this longstanding debate you could turn to the Library of Humanity's
extensive collection of articles on the <u>Validity and Susceptibility
	to Tampering of Mind Vaults</u>.</p>

<p><i>Ymir</i> was apparently one of the more complex and expensive
designs built by StarCol.  ReNorse Consortium's <u>Financial Records</u>
are publicly available and the financiers of ReNorse did indeed build a
large amount of financial support for the group.  StarCol's own
<u>Financial Records</u> in cross-examination show that several other
groups may have also funneled money into <i>Ymir</i>'s development
although whom and why appears to have been hidden and then subsequently
lost.</p>

<p>Much of the ReNorse money went into the early development of the Mind
Vault system and Ymir dropped StarCol's more common cryostasis system
for an early generation Mind Vault system.  A Mind Vault system and Gene
Bank took up much less space than the typical cryostasis system, but
<i>Ymir</i> was most of the size of one of the cryo-ships.  The
remaining space was devoted to several other systems, most of which
remain largely a mystery.  Whatever they were, and the mythological and
historical documents hint at some incredibly interesting systems, they
enabled an unusually fast spread through the Ginnungagap's primary solar
system, and some sources believe they may even help to explain why the
<i>Ymir</i> did not survive long after colonization.  For those
interested, several possible theories as to the bulk of <i>Ymir</i>'s
equipment can be found in discussions of the keyword <u>Audhumla</u>,
which was found in several places within StarCol's records.</p>
