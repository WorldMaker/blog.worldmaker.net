title: 'Friday Night Concert: The Paradigm CD Release Concert'
---

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.paradigmgroove.com/">Paradigm</a> CD Release Concert was just amazing in terms of musical bang per buck.  There was 3 and half hours of beautiful live music from Paradigm and opening act <a class="reference external" href="http://www.liberationprophecy.com/here.html">Liberation Prophecy</a> <strong>and</strong> a copy of the CD being released by Paradigm, titled <em>Melodies for Uncertain Robots</em>, all for the low, low cost of $10 at the door.  My only complaints were about the venue itself, which I'll save for later.</p>
<p>I had heard a lot about Liberation Prophecy and I don't think the band had spent as much time in my ears prior to the concert.  I was impressed by what I heard and I plan to buy their CD when I get a chance.  The band has something of a &quot;psycho-lounge&quot; feel that I rather enjoyed.  With two saxophonists, an upright bass player and a female vocalist with that classic jazz timbre, there's almost a feeling of a band that might have been seen in a classic Jazz bar...  but then the lyrics are a bit bent and the music a bit more hectic and varied.</p>
<p>During one of their songs the drummer just a bit too enthusiastically struck a tom only to watch it tumble off its stand.  He had just the briefest look of &quot;damn&quot; on his face, but continued to drum without it, not skipping a beat.  A couple of the band members worked their way over to help reattach the drum and screw it a bit tighter this time, all the while he continued to play and eventually the band returned to the earlier themes and finished the &quot;song&quot;.  It's just the sort of impressive improvisation that can happen in a live performance that you couldn't capture in a CD.</p>
<p>I was introduced to Paradigm about a year ago by Pentrant/Tony, who has a friend in the band, at the BBC.  Paradigm seems to have only gotten stronger as a band since the last time I saw them.  Paradigm is in that fringe of Jazz and Rock where anything can happen.  I've got a small knowledge of the storied history of that fringe of Jazz and it's ties to the city of Louisville, and I certainly find it fitting that it was Louisville where the disparate elements of Paradigm bound together.  Maybe some day I'll write a bit more about my learnings of Louisville Jazz, even though I'm certainly not an expert on the subject.</p>
<p>Paradigm's show used a few interesting visual elements:  They played <em>La Planete sauvage</em> (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Planet">Fantastic Planet</a>) on a projector above the stage.  Also, they had a box of glow sticks, which they tossed at intervals into the crowd, encouraging a sort of glow stick war and lighting the cellar-room-dark <em>Headliners</em> in interesting movements.</p>
<p>Paradigm is something of a treat when live, with amazing improvisations lasting sometimes upwards of a half-hour in a &quot;song&quot;.  It's also great to see that they are supporters of the Internet Archive's Live Concert program.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.archive.org/details/paradigm">Paradigm Live Music Archive</a> has a couple of concert tapes already (available in everything from FLAC to &quot;radio&quot; MP3) and they promised this CD Release Concert would go up at some point in the future.</p>
<p>One of the things that particularly blew my mind (metaphorically speaking) in the set list was a cover of Radiohead's <em>Idiotechque</em>, which is one of those Radiohead songs that just about everyone has heard, at least somewhere in a movie.  They had everything that makes that song what it is, but they added an actual <em>groove</em>, making the song actual dance-able.  I was also surprised how well Thom Yorke's breathy, near whiny, almost irritating lyrics in the song translated into a groovy clarinet melody.  I can't think of many other bands that would attempt Radiohead lyrics as clarinet lines.</p>
<p>Anyway, my only problems were that I'm not a huge fan of <em>Headliners Music Hall</em>.  The last concert I saw there (Umphrey's McGee, about a year ago) was prior to the smoking ban and I had something of a claustrophobia attack between the alcohol I had with dinner and what looked to me like a falling ceiling of smoke.  I'm not normally claustrophobic so it was a bit weird.  I promised I wouldn't go back until after the smoking ban, and I didn't.  Several months after the smoking ban you still walk out of Headliners smelling like a used ashtray...  My particular grievance is the bar is poorly stocked, at least in the beer department, and my impression is that being at least half an asshole is a requirement for the bartenders, which usually points to a deeper management issue in a bar from my experience.  I sat there and watched a guy order a beer and a glass of water.  I get to the same bartender, ask for a glass of water and get told I need to pay $2 for a bottle of water.  Such an asshole thing for a bar/bartender to do and I was pissed.   Honestly, Louisville has some of the best, cheapest tap water in the country and if you can't gladly give me a glass of tap water, particularly as someone trying to be a sober/designated driver, that should be some sort of ABC license violation.  Maybe I should find a council person to persuade to legislate that...</p>
