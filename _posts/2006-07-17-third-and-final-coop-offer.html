title: Third (and Final!) Coop Offer
---
<p>I'm really excited.  I just got official word today that I'm getting getting an offer to come back in the Fall or Spring.  (Which of the two and some other details are still in the air at the moment...)  The offer is coming from my current group here at Microsoft (the newly renamed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/accounting/prodinfo/default.mspx">Office Accounting</a> group), which is a bit of a mixed blessing.  I've been very happy with this group, and I'll get the ability to have some continuity with my current project, which is great.  On the other hand there are so many crazy/cool MSFT groups that I'd be just as happy trying something new.  I'll probably keep talking to some, just to get a feel for what I might want to do should I contemplate going full-time after I finish my degree.</p>
<p>I'm really happy just knowing that I can stop worrying about my coop requirements and can now focus on getting the last bits of the degree requirements puzzle in place.</p>
