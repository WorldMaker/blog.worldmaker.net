title: Showing off my story works...
---
<p>I've had these pages around for a while, and I mentioned them before, but I finally added a big link to <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/work/">my story works</a> from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldmaker.net/">my frontpage</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unlore.com/">unlore</a>.  I might move those pages entirely to unlore, but I'm still debating that, but that would at least get some content there.  I kept hoping to &quot;finish&quot; those pages before adding links on the front pages, but I don't when I expect to be &quot;done&quot; and I've put it off long enough as it is.  (It was pointed out that those pages were &quot;missing&quot; by a relative when I realized that I still hadn't put front page links up.)  I'm not sure it'll ever be &quot;done&quot; anyway, due to the loss of my desktop hard drive a few months back.  Beyond lack of &quot;finish&quot;/&quot;polish&quot;, there's still some other issues with the story pages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I'm not sure if I've cataloged every story in the archives of my blog.  I know that I don't have every story I've ever posted, but I also realize that I have that huge gap pre-2004.  I'm not sure if I'll ever get some of those stories back...</li>
<li>Some stories are badly formatted due to database export and then re-import.  I'm not sure if I can fix that.  I might not have the original word docs anymore for some/all of them...  I could do it by hand (it's mostly bad punctuation), but that could take a while.</li>
<li>I still haven't decided what to do with non-fiction/school projects that I've posted to the blog that might be worth highlighting.  At the very least, I'd still love any suggestions for &quot;best of&quot; blog articles that I should highlight.</li>
</ul>
