<p>My website is a place that I fill with the random thoughts that cross my mind in addition to those works and experiments I feel need their own space or merit larger attention...  Feel free to explore.  Things are in something of a mess as I lost several months of content and an entire design template (and moved to a new host for those reasons) and am busy piecing things back together.  Due to the fresh start I also decided to move on to a fresh CMS engine (<a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>) which has been a learning experience.  It has some nice advantages to the hodgepodge I used previously, even if I miss having my own code involved.  (I guess that could change eventually if I write a module or two for Drupal...)</p>
