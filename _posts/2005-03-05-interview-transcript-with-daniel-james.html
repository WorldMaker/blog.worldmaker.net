title: Interview Transcript with Daniel James
---
<p>I interviewed <a href="http://www.djames.org">Daniel James</a> for a Comm 112 assignment.</p>
<!--break-->
<blockquote title="Daniel James">
<p>arr,</p>

<blockquote title="Max Battcher">First of all, I just saw the announcement of the publishing deal with 
Ubisoft (and the follow-up slashdot post).  Congratulations on that. 
How do you feel about that?  What do you think retail box sales might 
be able to do for Puzzle Pirates?</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully bring us a LOT more subscribers. All but one of the MMORPGs on 
the market have benefitted tremendously from a retail release.</p>

<blockquote title="Max Battcher">
<h3>Background Information</h3>

What sort of degree is "Computing and Philosophy"?  Where are its foci?
</blockquote>

<p>It was a strange degree largely the result of a couple of professors 
being split between two departments. I ended up doing a lot of Logic, 
which I don't like very much, along with classes in Computer Science and 
Philosophy.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">
What things have you learned in your academic career that have been
insightful in your business career?
</blockquote>

<p>Relationships and mentoring are tremendously important. My relationships 
with my goood teachers were definitely the most valuable part of 
academia.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Do you plan on going for a graduate degree?</blockquote>


<p>That's the plan. I need that PhD to be a professor.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">How much did you focus on grades/marks?</blockquote>


<p>Before going to University I was a triple-A student. Later I realised 
that I could get top marks without such ludicrous over-work.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">What courses, looking back, do you regret taking?  Not taking?</blockquote>


<p>I wish I'd taken less Logic and more Anthropology, Sociology, 
Psychology, Biology and other varied courses more related to making 
games.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">When did the realization hit that you wanted to be working with virtual
worlds/muds? </blockquote>


<p>I realised this when I was around 13 years old, after I made Wizard on 
Essex MUD (the first of its kind) and started making my own. I 
re-confirmed this realisation again at 18, 23 and 30.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">What importance do you see in the field?</blockquote>


<p>I think virtual worlds are, to paraphrase Mr Arthur C. Clarke, going to 
'eat television alive'. I view this as a good, good thing. I believe 
that they have a pivotal role in our future evolution to becoming a 
better human race. </p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">What first caused you to get involved more in the business side of virtual
worlds/muds?</blockquote>


<p>Starting my own with a partner, Avalon, in 1989.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">What types of investment have you raised?  How have you built the credit?
Any good war stories?</blockquote>


<p>I've raised only fairly small amounts of money from investors for ooo. 
Mostly we funded it ourselves. I don't have any great stories save that 
I wear my pirate hat when I do investor presentations and never take 
myself too seriously.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">The shutting down of Yosemite Entertainment and it's Middle Earth Online was
watched by many on the Internet.  On <a href="http://www.thecan.org/">theCan.org</a> you list some of the reasons
why it failed.  Were there any particular lessons you learned from this failed
project?  Other failed projects?</blockquote>


<p>Lots. Big companies are disasters. Large teams are unwieldly and hard to 
manage. Both breed poor performance from people, and foster people who 
really shouldn't be around. Some of the mates on the middle-earth team 
refused to read the books -- they might 'listen to them on CD'. That 
said mostly it was just bad management.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">If you had the choice: Lead a development company or just develop?</blockquote>


<p>Choice made. Lead.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">
<h3>Three Rings</h3>
When you hire for a smaller company like <a href="http://www.threerings.net">Three Rings</a>, what are some the
criteria you feel are particularly important when examining candidates?</blockquote>


<p>Very smart and get stuff done.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Do you prefer a smaller team?  If so, how do you plan to limit its growth?</blockquote>


<p>Yes. A game should only have ~10-12 people on it, tops (not including 
OMs).</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Where do you see Three Rings going in the near future?  Where would you like
to see it go in the long term?</blockquote>


<p>More subscribers for PP. Long term, more games. Longer term, a real 
challenge to the current publishers in the online space.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Just out of curiosity, was there any particular reason the company was
located in San Francisco?</blockquote>


<p>Throw a network card and hit an engineer. SF attracts smart geeky people 
who are a bit wacky. That fits us.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">
<h3>Puzzle Pirates</h3>

Was there a particular insight that <a href="http://www.puzzlepirates.com">Puzzle Pirates</a> came from?  Was the idea
of combining puzzles and Pirates a stroke of lightning or a process?
</blockquote>


<p>Strong of lightning. I'd wanted to make a PIrate MMORPG, then the Puzzle 
thing just fell from the sky and hit me. After that it was obvious.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Just out of curiosity, is Puzzle Pirates yet profitably self-sustaining?</blockquote>


<p>Nearly. We have more developers than we should, but we have been 
momentarily profitable, and hope to be so again. If we had a skeleton 
staff it would be quite profitable.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">In designing the game, how concerned were you with encouraging grouping over
soloing?</blockquote>


<p>Quite concerned. I think socialisation is the heart of these games.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Several VW/MMO*/MU* designers have expressed annoyance with fan suggestions
and design discussions.  What are your feelings on this? You appear to
encourage these suggestions and discussions, and you and your team seem to
post fairly often in the "Game Design" forum.  What value do you see in this?</blockquote>


<p>I love the players and often they have great insights that we as 
developers just can't have. I wish I had more time to listen to them. 
Sometimes they can be annoying, but mostly that is a few tarters, and 
that's to be expected.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Thus far, how "sticky" has the game been?  (How long do players typically
stay?)  What have you done to encourage long time players?</blockquote>


<p>This is confidential. Around a year.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">How long do you see the game lasting?  How long would you like to see the
game last?</blockquote>


<p>Forever. I think that people will be playing in at least ~20 years. 
Maybe not many, but a few. These things have a way of lasting, people 
still play Avalon over 15 years later.</p>

<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Where do you see the game going in the short term?  Long term?</blockquote>


<p>More stuff, more players. Then more platforms (e.g. phones).</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Any idea yet on the sort of game you see trying to do next?</blockquote>


<p>We have some ideas. Nothing decided.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">
<h3>Puzzle Pirates Economics</h3>

There are several instances of markets trading virtual currencies (such as
EverQuest gold, SWG credits) outside of the games, and often back and forth
with US dollars.  Many developers are outright annoyed by these markets and
hope to shut them down.  Others, such as Jullian Dibbell believe in fighting
for the "virtual property rights" to help make this all the more legitimate.
As far as I can tell, Puzzle Pirates poe has yet to be traded for cash outside
of the game, but as the game grows larger the possibility of such a thing
increases.  What are your feelings on this?  Would you encourage or discourage
such activities?
</blockquote>

<p>See the Doubloons threads and FAQS etc. recently announced. In short I'm 
not going to try to turn back the tide, but rather make a fine boat and 
float on it.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">The two major tendencies of an economy is stagnation and/or inflation.  What
sort of steps have you made to combat these ills?  How active of an
involvement do you take in the economy?</blockquote>


<p>We track it closely. PP PoE inflation is pretty low, we're almost too 
good at sucking money out.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher"><h3>Puzzle Pirates Politics</h3>

Just like the economy, politics seems to have a tendency towards stagnation
or chaos.  What sort of steps to you take to combat these extremes?</blockquote>


<p>We need to shake things up more.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">What do think of the Notorious Fandango's attempts to shake up the ocean?
Appropriately piratey or just annoying?</blockquote>


<p>Appropirate.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher"><h3>Puzzle Pirates Technical</h3>

What sort of difficulties has using Java made?  How has using Java affected
development time?  Code readability?
</blockquote>

<p>Massively improved both. Difficulties are just as you'd find with any 
platform, bugs etc.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">The possibility has been mentioned of open sourcing Puzzle Pirates. What
sort of time frame do you think would be good for such a release? Would you
release the client and/or server code?  Do you plan to compete with user-run
Oceans or wait until Puzzle Pirates is older and less of an income source?
</blockquote>

<p>We won't open-source PP as such, but will provide some of our tools for 
making small games. Announcement coming soon.</p>


<blockquote title="Max Battcher">Thanks again for your time.  I hope I haven't been too much of a bother.
I'm sorry if I've deluged too many questions on you.   :-)   Let me know if you
have any questions.</blockquote>

<p>Sorry if this is late. I tried! Been very busy.</p>
