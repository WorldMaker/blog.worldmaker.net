title: Matriculation Get

<p>Yesterday I sat (and walked and stood at the appropriate points in time) through the three graduation ceremony at the Kentucky International Convention Center.  I only have one grade missing on my transcript and expect that one to get filled any moment now.</p>
<p>But it seems that I'm done.  I've got no more plans for school in the immediate future. I've achieved my MEng degre.  I will also soon have to worry about loan repayments, insurance and all of the other fun stuff of trying to make it in the &quot;real&quot; world.  I need to follow back up with my job search leads, soon...  Maybe I'll get a couple of my own projects to the point where they might generate at least some small, tiny amount of income.</p>
<p>But first maybe I'll play some games and try to at least celebrate a little...</p>
