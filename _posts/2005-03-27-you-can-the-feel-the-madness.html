title: You can the feel the Madness!
---
<p>Boo-yah!  Louisville is making a well deserved return to the venerable ranks of the Final Four!  This huge college sports time is excited.  You can feel it, the air is nigh electric.  The heart-pounding, last minute over time game was a hell of a thing to watch, and now the relief is palpable.  It's looking like we may yet see another Dream Game Championship this year if our big brothers at UK can keep their end up.</p>
