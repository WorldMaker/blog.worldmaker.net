title: Sam and Max meet Star Wars Canon
---
<p>I certainly gave up on Star Wars (which I have since the last film pronounced &quot;dead to me&quot;), but I am glad that there are still some fun to be found in the &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; (C-Canon and S-Canon works).  (I can no longer stand and in some cases outright hate G-Canon.)  Here's the thing that amused me recently: <a class="reference external" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Max_%28lagomorph%29">Max</a> (Wookieepedia) of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.samandmax.net">Sam and Max</a> (Ye old unofficial fan site from my old <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mixnmojo.com/">International House of Mojo</a> stomping grounds, from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mixnmojo.com/php/news/showfile.php?id=2255&amp;category=lucasfilmnews">whence</a> this is via, btw) is considered (C-)canon in Star Wars, due to lending his bounty-hunting skills as a sidekick to Kyle Katarn in DF:JK for a couple of missions...  Dark Forces (the first game, not the Jedi Knight follow-ups) is still one of the few Star Wars computer games I recall fondly.</p>
