title: Madiolahb Preview
---
<p>I've uploaded a first preview build of the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/madiolahb/">Madiolahb</a> library <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> on <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/">PyPI</a>, which means that you can install this preview release with <tt class="docutils literal">easy_install</tt> or, better yet, <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> if you have Python and one or the other installer on your system.</p>
<p>The latest <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.python.org/madiolahb/">Madiolahb documentation</a> is now also up on PyPI and this will be where I will keep it up to date now. I'm going to slack on updating the appspot site until I've got a preview build for the REST API.</p>
<p>The big deal here is that Madiolahb is now a standalone library (the AppEngine code will depend on it rather than vice versa) and that it has a command line script (just <tt class="docutils literal">madiolahb</tt> when installed via <tt class="docutils literal">easy_install</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt>). You can explore the API in Python if you wish, or you can try to <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.python.org/madiolahb/api.html#play-by-command-line">Play By Command Line</a> using JSON (or YAML if you prefer) files and command line pipes. It has useful starter help documentation (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-h</span></tt>), and I think a very good tool to start examining.</p>
<p>There are a lot of known bugs and unfinished commands. It's still not quite &quot;Bhaloidam standard&quot; yet, but getting there. There are a lot of things I need to redocument or document for the first time. I need to start on the REST API handlers. I want to get the old text parser back together (and available from the command line). I should get code pages up on my website with the change log and a link to an up-to-date source repository. But this is a decent starting point. I think the command line feel here (bugs withstanding) should provide some idea into my thought processes for Madiolahb and a decent idea of where it is going. Feedback is welcome/encouraged.</p>
