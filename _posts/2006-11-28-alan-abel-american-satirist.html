title: 'Alan Abel: An American Satirist'
---
<p>I recently encountered <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alanabel.com">Alan Abel</a> in a recent Wikipedia pedestrianation (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Abel">Alan Abel's Wikipedia entry</a>).  I've took about taking absurd hoaxes to their extreme conclusions, and so it's an almost immediate admiration.  He took several politcally-motivated hoaxes (satiring some of the lowest elements of the political system) across several years of active work.  Most defining is his 3 year &quot;SINA&quot; (Society for Indecency to Animals) campaign that had Buck Henry pretending to be the President of an organization attempting to clothe large 4-legged animals.  People even tried to contribute to the fake organization.</p>
<p>I'm very interested to see the documentary on him, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.abelraisescain.com/">Abel Raises Cain</a>.</p>
<p>On a side note, I'm tempted by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.timelife.com/checkout/micro.jsp?pageId=1183&amp;page=getsmart">Get Smart Box DVD Set</a>.  (Something of the Wikipedia path I meandered the other day: Casino Royale -&gt; Baccarrat (simple Blackjack-like casino game that offers the closest casino bet to 50:50, and the game in the book) -&gt; James Bond -&gt; Get Smart -&gt; Buck Henry -&gt; Alan Abel; somewhere in there was DuMont as well (The Lost American Television Network).)</p>
