title: 'Star Trek Online Fan Fiction: Fiara and the Sophorians'
---
<p>Normally I don't preface my fiction, but this is mediocre fan fiction at
best and probably needs a fair warning. <em>Star Trek Online</em> has put me in
a mood I haven't felt in years to write some bad <em>Star Trek</em> fan fiction.
Something about the limited impact a player can have on a current
generation MMO always tends to bring out weirdly deep character back
stories from me. I'm not entirely sure why I'm posting it here, feel free to ignore it, but maybe someone will find it funny or interesting. (Hire me, I promise that I can also write better than this!)</p>
<p>STO doesn't have social pages up yet, or I would link directly to the
character, so a screenshot will have to suffice. Star Trek, as always,
is Copyright CBS Studios, and Star Trek Online and its character creator
are Copyright Cryptic Studios. I'm referencing these works within my
fair use rights. The portions that are my own insanity and creativity I
reserve some rights in accordance with my usual Creative Commons

<p>Fiara (Rekam, Fiara Wisdom) is a tall, thin, wiry alien with pink skin. As with many
players, I do enjoy playing at the extremes of the character builder.
(Although it seems to me that more prefer to play at the small end,
rather than the tall one, which I always found odd in the superhero
MMOs...) Then of course I had to answer what race she was from and why
she was on the fast path to being an Officer in the Federation...</p>
<p>First a biography and then a couple of more detailed logs. I realize
that logs aren't the best way to write the tale that follows (and I also
realize that I fall into the trap of making my character special in
crazy ways, but like I said, it's my way of rebelling against the
system), but on the other hand it is a very <em>Star Trek</em> form of
storytelling. Also, there are too many parentheses. (I should probably also remind you that the opinions of my characters are not necessarily my own.)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Fiara's people, the Sophorians, are a relatively new, yet highly
contentious addition to the Federation. The Sophorians have a deep
Engineering culture that in controversial areas such as terraforming and
genetic engineering even surpass the skills of most of the Federation.
With such a high level of engineering talent embedded in many aspects of
the species, the Sophorians were slow to show any signs of warp
technology and thus were actively studied by Federation scientists. When
the Sophorians did put a warp test together, it was clearly reverse
engineered from Federation technology. In the Prime Directive hearing
that followed it became somewhat clear that the Sophorians had done a
better job studying the Federation than vice versa. Fiara is one of the
first Sophorian officers in Starfleet, and an erstwhile ambassador to
Starfleet for her people. Even her Starfleet Academy nickname &quot;Wisdom&quot;
shows that Fiara is on her way towards proving her people's innate
engineering talents.</p>

<p>Mark Verdant --- Chief Science Officer's Log --- Sophorian Research
Center</p>
<!-- TODO: Stardate? -->
<p>I'm going to try my best to sum up several decades of research. I don't
expect this will help defend me during my impending Prime Directive
Hearing. However, I realize that the Sophorians have already petitioned
the Federation Council for membership and I hope to provide the Council
with as much of the relevant data as possible. I've been the Chief
Science Officer in the Sophoros system for a handful of Sophorian years.
I was recently invited to explore Sophorian culture first hand, and I
expect that, regardless of the outcome of my hearing, I will be the
Federation expert on the Sophorians for near term.</p>
<p>Sophoros is a Beta Quadrant system that was first noticed by the
Federation for having five inhabitable planets and moons, all of nearly
Earth-like atmosphere and composition. For this reason, it is often
casually referred to as &quot;the Garden System&quot; by some researchers. The
Sophorian home world, although it is most likely not their planet of
origination, is the smallest of these bodies: a moon we generally refer
to as Sophoria Prime. Sophoria Prime is just a fraction smaller than
Luna back home.</p>
<p>All of the habitats in the system show one telltale sign of artificial
terraforming at some point in their history, including Sophoria Prime.
Starfleet's initial interest in the system stems from the mystery of who
terraformed these worlds, and to what purpose. Further passes were
allowed to study some of the non-sentient lifeforms on the planets in
the system outside of Sophoria Prime. These passes revealed some of the
richest genetic manipulation the Federation has seen.</p>
<p>Presuming that the Sophorians themselves have been involved, and
continue to be involved, in the technology of terraforming and genetic
engineering, Starfleet knew that a permanent installation would be a
high risk. Ultimately the risk was considered and debated at the
Federation Council, where it passed with a slim minority vote. Knowing
the risks, the Sophorian Research Center was granted a science license
for cloaking technology. The Center was established on the outer edges
of the system and designed to generally stay eclipsed behind the
system's sun, with respect to Sophoria Prime. A limited schedule of
probe launches was authorized, along with much of the usual collection
of sensor banks and astrometric devices.</p>
<p>Within the first few months of Center operations, the first crisis
happened when the sensors picked up the standard residue of teleporters.
Visual confirmation from the sensors followed that a small group of
Sophorians had gone on &quot;picnic&quot; (the Sophorians seem to find amusement
in the universal translators attempt at this word, and have started
using it themselves, at least when around us) to one of the larger
planets. The Center was nearly closed immediately following this find,
but was left open again in a last minute, minority Council vote.</p>
<p>(The Sophorian picnics across their system only reinforced the concept
of the solar system as a large garden. I was an early proponent for the
theory, which I think has now been proven correct, that these worlds
were just as much laboratories as gardens and that the Sophorians have
long, patient experiments over the course of centuries, if not
millennia. Certainly I am professionally jealous of the apparent
Sophorian scientific research studies.)</p>
<p>Further examination turned up a sequence of devices implanted in system
asteroids act as a transporter relay network for the system, connecting
transporter pads (which initial surveys obviously failed to recognize)
spread across the habitable planets. An engineer on my team summarized
decades of studying the relay network as &quot;incredible&quot; and &quot;frustratingly
insane&quot;. The metaphor that I finally pulled from him that I could
comprehend was that Sophorian transporter technology appears &quot;inside
out&quot; compared to normal Federation transporters: &quot;things that should be
passed along subspace are sent at lightspeed or worse, and things that
barely seem worth buffering are shunted through subspace&quot;. Of course any
summary will make the facts seem simpler than they are in reality. The
exact details can be found in the appropriate Center logs.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, transporter relay networks haven't been needed by the
Federation, as impulse engines and warp drives handle most of
Federation's intra-system needs. Impulse Engines and Warp Drives
generally proceed development of Transporter technology, seemingly
universally in galactic development judging from Federation logs. The
Sophorians for most of the Center's study period showed zero signs of
impulse engine or warp core design, and yet they control and presumably
built this complex transporter relay network that in some ways surpasses
what the Federation has even attempted to do.</p>
<p>(One of the Center's engineers in her spare time made a fairly precise
simulation of how the Sophorians might have launched their relay
satellites into the asteroid belts using nothing more than crude
chemical rockets and speeds far less than any modern impulse engine. The
simulation certainly resulted in a beautiful balletic display, if
nothing else.)</p>
<p>The second crisis was a few years later when routine diagnostics and an
updated sensor pattern filter ended up collecting a number of, in
hindsight, obvious signs of Sophorian replicator usage across the entire
history log collected by Center sensors. It would seem that the original
pattern was set to a value fairly high, as if to compensate for the
background usage of replicators on a station ten times the size of the
small Center.</p>
<p>Certainly the replicator usage was a smaller surprise after the
transporter relay network, but it still got logged back through proper
channels and nearly resulted in the dissolution of the Research Center.
This time the vote was more favorable towards continued research, as the
diagnostics check made it further unlikely that the Sophorians were
hiding impulse or warp technology that our sensors could not observe.</p>
<p>The most recent crisis, resulting in the impending Prime Directive
Hearing, is the first Sophorian warp test. This is quite possibly one of
the strangest first contact the Federation has encountered, and the
Center is certainly a key piece in this, and I don't envy the Starfleet
Judiciary Board the task of deciding how much of this was a preventable
violation of the Prime Directive. Certainly there are critics that still
believe the Center should have been shut down following the first or
second crisis.</p>
<p>I'm told the warp core itself looked almost exactly like one of the more
common models used primarily by the Federation. The consensus from my
engineering team, however, is that the design shows some signs that the
core was built as if from first principles in a Starfleet Academy lab.
They said the feeling they got was as if they were looking at an Academy
experiment built at a slightly larger scale, more attention to detail
than a typical Academy student, and by someone that obviously knew the
theory inside and out, but seemed to have never managed to actually see
a real one in action up until that point. (The Academy Engineer
colloquialism for such a design apparently is something along the lines
of calling it &quot;an earthborn special&quot;.)</p>
<p>While I do not feel culpable in any Prime Directive violation, I can't
feel much more than awe with regard to the Sophorian warp test. After
decades of no noticeable warp development activity, the Sophorians, on a
time and date of their choice, made a first and immediately successful
warp test. Simultaneously the Sophorians sent a perfectly coded subspace
message to the Starfleet Admiralty of peace and ambassadorial goodwill.
(Including a very extensive universal translator database.</p>
<p>At the Center we received our own message, personally inviting us as
guests of the Sophorian graduation ceremony. I do feel culpable in this
violation of standard first contact doctrine, but it is not often that a
researcher is personally invited to share notes with the very subjects
of one's research.</p>
<p>I hope to visit the next Sophorian graduation ceremony, as I think I
could fill an entire memoir of Sophorian graduation ceremony memories.
Graduation combines many holidays into one grand one: birthday, school
graduations, rites of passage, honeymoons, new years, and many other
celebrations of the stages of life and death. Sophorian generations
(many of us prefer that term, but the universal translator makes it
obvious the words generation and class are the same for the Sophorians
and that class is their preference) are very tight-knit, due to both a
small overall population size and tight population controls.</p>
<p>Our first experience was the graduation from secondary/technical
education of a class. The graduates from the Sophorian Academy of
Engineering were particularly impressive to us researchers. I'm sure a
couple of my engineering buddies would have talked to the Sophorian
engineers for days on end, given the opportunity. I myself was impressed
that after only a few decades of decoding and studying the Federation
the young Sophorians had a seemingly better grasp of the Federation and
its politics than some of the professors I could recall from my days in
Starfleet Academy. One bright young Sophorian woman even asked for a
personal recommendation to Starfleet Academy to further her studies. I
hope that the Academy Admissions looks favorably upon that
recommendation, regardless of the outcome of my Prime Directive Hearing
or Sophorian admission to the Federation...</p>
<p>Sophorian physiology is a fascinating subject in itself. Sophorians are
taller than the average hominid in the galaxy; they are tall, lean, and
wiry in a way that one might expect from a race adapted to a low gravity
moon. Their rubicund pink skin color belies a more complex than average
(red-blooded) circulatory system, that is designed (probably by their
own ancestors) to work nearly as well in larger gravities. Like Vulcans,
Sophorians are generally long-lived and spend much of their lives in
study. Sophorian ears are even pointed somewhat like Vulcan ears, and
crasser researchers than I have referred to these gentle giants as &quot;pink
tree elves&quot;.</p>
<p>I feel I need to bring up their physiology here because it connects the
first and second events we witnessed graduation week. It was obvious,
due to comparatively small to their frames mammalian endowments (which
were of course seemed quite big in comparison to those of us from a
shorter species) that the Engineering Academy graduates were all female.
A few researchers with me remarked on this fact, but we chalked it up to
the statistically small sample size (two women engineers out of a 3:4
female to male ratio)... That is, until we witnessed the Rite of
Adolescence.</p>
<p>The Rite of Adolescence (this is another interesting thing we learned
from the universal translator, that the Sophorians have a surprisingly
similar close relationship between the words &quot;right&quot; and &quot;rite&quot;) to the
Sophorians is the passage between primary and secondary education. It
reveals several fascinating aspects of the Sophorians in a very quick
manner that we never would have been able to observe from the Center.</p>
<p>Sophorians are born androgynous and are awarded their secondary sexual
characteristics during the Rite of Adolescence. (We were lead to believe
that primary sexual characteristics are chosen for a mated couple only
in the course of the Right of Procreation.) The top half of a class, as
determined by a complicated weighted score of recommendation and primary
education scores, are awarded &quot;nurturer&quot; status, given female mammalian
sexual characteristics and usually offered guaranteed acceptance into
the Engineering Academy. (The Rite, and apparently Sophorian culture,
connects a lot of symbolism and metaphor to their &quot;nurturer&quot; mythos,
believing science and engineering themselves to be deeply &quot;nurturing&quot;. I
expect entire books to be written on the subject.)</p>
<p>Presuming the typical hominid attraction biases, and we have been given
no reason to suspect otherwise, this seems a rather unique way to aim at
a reasonable bell-curve in genetic diversity amongst mating couples
rather than strictly selecting for a progressively incestuous &quot;best of
the best&quot; trap that most eugenics programs typically fall into... Of
course that is all supposition on my part and I have no reason to
suspect that this system is a part of the species' genetic experiments,
nor do I have any information as to the background of these contemporary
practices. I certainly am interested in further researching this topic,
should I be given that chance.</p>
<p>I've heard some of my fellow researchers call this an unusual caste
system, and I do hope to dispel any fear of that amongst the Federation
Council, as I know that the Sophorians have already applied for
Federation membership and caste systems are forbidden membership, for
good reason.</p>
<p>If Starfleet Academy started mandating permanent forehead tattoos upon
admission, would that make Starfleet a caste? The use of body
characteristics with such deep evolutionary baggage to mammalian
hominids certainly makes this a more interesting debate than if just
tattoos were involved.</p>
<p>Sophorian &quot;outer&quot; males appear to aspire to any and every position in
Sophorian society, everything we saw was the balanced gender mix and
equal opportunity we see of most of the Federation, and don't seem to be
hampered by their lack of a scholastic &quot;merit badge&quot;. The score cutoffs
vary from class to class (the Sophorians appearing to try to keep an
even split between the outer genders), and there is certainly many
opportunities for respect across class lines. I was informed that there
were even Rites that allowed for mobility between outer genders.</p>
<p>(On the other hand, it certainly isn't entirely roses. I did hear of a
legend regarding a possible historic lower caste. It appeared that some
&quot;Old Matrons&quot;, as they would say, would sometimes scare young
pre-adolescents into studying harder by threatening them that the stupid
and evil can be left genderless, possibly for the rest of their lives.
If there is a historic basis in this legend, it also sits on a debatable
boundary between caste system and penitentiary/reform system.)</p>
<p>The Sophorians are a unique, rich race that has only recently had any
interest in the universe beyond their own, very rich and controlled
system. I expect that they will bring an interestingly rich, new
perspective to the Federation, and I expect great things from them if
the Council can see to offer them membership. Of course, I suppose I am
biased on that matter, having studied this wonderful people from so many
different angles over the years.</p>

<p>Excerpts from the Redactions applied to the Debate Log of the Tellarite
Councillor upon the Vote for Membership of the Planet Sophoria Prime ---
Classified</p>
<p>...This whole thing is a sham! We all know the President has the power
to grant the membership, without involving the Council. But, something
is weirdly special about this dumb little moon and the Executive Branch
doesn't want that broadcasted, so they hand the decision over to the
Council to rubber-stamp the opinion they've already formed! Then they
dare to immediately censure my debate, before I've even got started!...</p>
<p>...It's very clear from this report that these aliens are dangerous!
Genetic Engineering! Terraforming! How can we trust these &quot;Sophorians&quot;?
Do I need to remind every damn person on this Council of Federation
Statutes and Eugenics Wars? Better yet, I've got some choice snippets
from the logs of Starfleet's own infamous Admiral Kirk we could
replay...</p>
<p>...Who is that damn guy? [The esteemed Councillor points a finger at a
bland looking human Starfleet crewman wearing no combadge or rank
insignia.] I know enough about Starfleet to know it's very weird for a
crewman with no rank to command the ears of every Admiral in the room!
He certainly doesn't look like our dutifully elected President to me!...</p>
<p>...and another thing! This gender caste thing certainly scares me! Do
you want it to happen to your children? <em>Seems to me like it might solve
a lot of problems in the Federation!</em> Hah. Forced celibacy? Gender
assigned by some standardized test and a cabal of elders? This stupid
report doesn't even bother hiding any of this! Is this the future of the
galaxy? These genetic engineering--loving aliens probably think it is!
These people make the stupid Andorians and their four genders seem
almost sensible!...</p>
