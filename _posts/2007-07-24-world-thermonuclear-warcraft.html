<p>I love that suspense of dialing into a new system.  The anticipation just rises as you wait out the handshake and give the terminal time to slowly fill with characters, the graceful dance almost hypnotic as you try to decipher its contents a handful of letters at a time.  You never know what will be waiting for you on the other side.  {Attached print out:</p>

The display shifted from characters to showing images.  Not the crude images I'm familiar with...  these were in color and amazingly detailed.  A box popped up decorated with some sort of cartoon &quot;flame dog&quot;.  There was a box inside that box with one of those &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://">http://</a>&quot; things and another box that said something like &quot;Goggle&quot;...</p>
