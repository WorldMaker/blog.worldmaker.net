title: Comm 112 Persuasion Speech
---
<p>On Monday, the 4th of April, I presented a speech on copyright and why a business oriented person should keep the Creative Commons licenses in mind.  Basically, I boiled down my <a href="/cecs311/liberty">Ethics &amp; Law paper</a> into digest form.  They go well hand in hand.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/comm112/outline.doc">Outline</a> - I'm not too happy about the formatting (full sentences instead of topic names), but it is the format the teacher requested.</li>
<li><a href="/comm112/speech.ppt">Presentation</a> - This the PowerPoint file I used.</li>
</ul>
