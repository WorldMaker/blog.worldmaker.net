title: Characters Classes, Damage Knobs, and a Political Analogy
---

Coming out of the [primer on RPG character archetypes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-31-politics-character-classes %})
I came upon a deeper dive into a inner subject that I felt is a useful expansion
upon the primer's implications for political activism/reaction.

I'm not sure how generally useful it may be, but it felt like a good vocabulary to
describe some of my biggest concerns in the current political climate. At least
in that regard it seemed particularly useful to me, especially in that I've had
something of a self-imposed ban on direct political blogging since way back in
Ought Five. I could see a use in having an analogy vocabulary that could at least
air some of my grievances without directly pointing fingers (or that much blame,
hopefully).

# Damage Knobs

In previous article, I discussed the three very large and looming archetypes.
Similarly there are three main "damage knobs" that can be discussed as something
of the next layer down. I'm going to refer to these as damage primarily, to keep
things mostly simple, especially as I head towards analogy, but one thing to note
is that healing is a direct dual (in most RPG realms) of damage, just with the
signs reversed (adding health points instead of removing them) and the target
audience reversed (allies rather than enemies). (Keeping in mind that there can
be a duality there is likely useful, but not required, for the analogy work I
expect to follow.)

Magnitude
: Magnitude/power is the amount of damage of a strike.

Area of Effect (AoE)
: AoE is the area/space/number of enemies affected by a strike.

Damage over Time (DoT)
: DoT is the duration of a strike.

It's not entirely coincidence that there are three of these main knobs as well.
Game designers often love the rule of three; it's a classic
magic number for both storytelling reasons and complexity reasons. Two opposed
options, a binary choice, often feels too simplistic, but three seems to our minds
to be the first point where things seem complex to our human brain, but actually 
dealing with the overall number of combinations is reasonable. Consider this the
"Rock-Paper-Scissors rule of game design". A lot of game mechanics feel like
fancy versions of Rock-Paper-Scissors, because they in fact are. It's an easy
pattern for a game design to reuse, over and over, and get a lot of surprising
to our primate minds complexity boiling out structures that are mostly just
variants of Rock-Paper-Scissors all the way down.

I mention this because there is a tendency to think that these knobs, because
they describe a roughly triangular map like the archetypes do, are essentially
a "fractal" layer. These knobs have certainly been used that way. The easiest way
to a simple nine class RPG system is to take the three archetypes and make one
class of each archetype hyper-specialized with one of the damage knobs "turned to
eleven" and the rest atrophied. There are plenty of RPGs that have done this, and
it's not a bad way to do it.

The thing is that the triangular map formed by these knobs isn't isomorphic, it
isn't the same exact shape as the archetypes map. I've seen great arguments that
it might be, but I think that is too narrow a view. In my mind though, I don't
think there are direct correlations between directions in the two maps, and
definitely not enough correlation to draw the maps fractally on top of each other.
If anything, the damage knobs more often seem to describe an orthogonal dimension
(a third dimension to the map).

I think that that very simple 9-class "fractal" system of RPG at this point
is seen as something of a simplistic throwback compared to modern systems. The
thing that a bunch of modern systems seemed to figure out roughly all at the same
time in fun convergent evolution, was that these damage knobs were often better
suited to leaving to player tactics rather than class bound. In many modern systems,
finding the balance between attacks that favor Magnitude over AoE, or attacks that
favor DoT, can become a interesting matter of a player's choice and situational
awareness. Classes and often equipment often are still biased towards one damage
knob or the other, some for obvious flavor reasons: a melee weapon often might
struggle with AoE damage but deliver big magnitude strikes; on the other side, a
melee weapon might be poisoned or on fire and deliver a very interesting DoT
effect.

Another reason to avoid thinking of it is a fractal layer is that unlike the
archetypes, in most games at least, you don't necessarily need all three sorts of
damage knobs in play to make a good team for the most difficult confrontations.
You might be able one-shot enemies one at a time quickly with a "glass cannon"
that might be extremely fragile but has huge magnitude strikes. You can AoE all
enemies simultaneously to just take them all down at once. You can even, with
patience and time on your side, DoT enemies to death. (I still have fond flashbacks
to an old character of mine in a passed away MMORPG that had huge AoE and a very
long duration DoT, but a tiny, tiny magnitude in strikes. Soloing was an interesting
puzzle of patience and stamina with that character, but she was so welcome on
teams, because in that AoE for that DoT the mobs were frozen [literally].)

## Mitigations

Giant magnitude damage can often be mitigated with enough armor or the right
kind of armor.

Area of Effect can often be mitigated by tactics: in games the AoE is often a geometric
shape (a conic section of space project from the character, or a circular
blast from a character's choice of parabolic descent, for two examples), controlling
the ground cover, flanking, grouping, and range on the battle field.

Damage over TIme can often be interrupted before it completes. (Douse the flames
with water; stop standing on the floor when it is lava.)

## Implication

The damage knobs don't have as many clear-cut implications on their own like
the archetypes do. There aren't necessarily any strong, out-of-the-box, trade-offs
between damage types like have been well established with the archetypes.

If there's an obvious strategy advice in games, it's an "offense in depth": the
more types of damage you bring to a conflict, the more prepared you are to adjust
your damage to the necessary tactical situation of the conflict, the better off you
likely are.

There are some subtle implications in the interplay between the archetypes and the
damage knobs. A support character might need to plan heals differently if they
know the primary damage of the team is going need time to act (DoT), versus quickly
healing a "glass cannon" in between one-shots.

# An Airing of Grievances

There are two particular issues I feel like getting off my chest: one is an AoE
problem, and the other is a DoT concern.

## An AoE problem

Social media, and especially one platform in particular, have been vexing me for
a few months now, and I think the issue is one of the AoE of messaging across those
platforms.

The AoE problem that a lot of people seem to complain about is the self-organizing
"bubble" problem. At this point I think that problem is way oversold: that's a
solvable problem of essentially player tactics. If "bubble bursting" is an issue,
you send in the Tanks. You bring in players that are willing to engage on the front
lines, and you pick the front lines to fight. Both platforms even provide tools
without needing Tanks to bubble burst if you can spare the cash. Of the two
platforms, the advertiser sponsored "micro-targeting" of micro-aggression on one
particularly concerns me because it is so ubiquitous and interleaved so much with
other content. (I guess this could be a magnitude problem to complete the trio,
in that yet again in human history, money buys undue amounts of power.)

The AoE problem that I think is often overlooked is a sort of "the medium is the
message" problem. There's the obvious surface level of this that the social media
themselves have fancied themselves as unaligned third parties and almost simple
dumb pipes. In trying to provide "no message", they instead create outlaw towns
full of micro-targeted micro-aggression. That is its own sort of message.

But just under the surface, "the median is the message". Traditional media had
very strong areas of effect: wide circulation and easy access to headlines. Social
media gives the impression of a wider area of effect: it is certainly possible for
a post to go viral and reach potentially millions or at least numbers that would
make old newspaper circulation counts seem paltry in comparison. What gets swept
under the rug, however, is the rarity of such an event (and on certain platforms
as much a fluke of opaque software algorithms than a legitimate tactical human
event), especially for anyone who
isn't already a celebrity. There is a very, very
long tail of the area of effect of posts on social media. The median area of
effect is much, much smaller than traditional media circulation. The median area
of effect, I would even wager is probably below Dunbar's Number (the theoretical
tribal "maximum" that something of a bound of our social groups). To some extent,
we might as well still be scrawling post-its on college campus telephone poles
for comparable audience sizes, even "signal boosted".

In this way, "bubbles" are also much more visibly a scapegoat. Dunbar's Number
suggests that even the best of us have a hard time with social networks above
certain sizes. It's a sad fact of our primate brain's existence. We have an
"American Dream paradox" at the heart of our social media: social media wants
us to think that any of us might be temporarily embarrassed celebrities that
everyone wants to hear our opinion, to keep our eyeballs, to keep our attention.
They want us to feel that sensation that the next thing we post could affect
millions. Surprise, we've all mostly just fragmented into classic human scale
tribes. We aren't allowing ourselves to be divided by bubbles, we are fragmented
and using bubbles to make the most sense of fragmentation.

## A DoT Concern

The Founders of the United States of America were very paranoid of fascism of
any kind. They planned a lot of complex damage over time "spells" throughout our
system of government. I find myself concerned these last few months that the
spells don't seem to be working, that they seem to have expired or been far too
easy to interrupt or far to easy to avoid in the first place.

At least from the ground level, outside of the government, it seems like
protections we expected to be in place aren't working, and that is very
frustrating and very concerning. I don't know how easy that is to deal with.

I understand, however, that DoT spells take time, that maybe I need more
patience with the systems. I still worry in the meantime how many layers will
be broken after this; how much it will cost to recast the spells, to rebuild
the "offense in depth" against fascism.
