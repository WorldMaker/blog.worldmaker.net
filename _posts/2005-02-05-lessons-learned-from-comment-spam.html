title: Lessons learned from comment spam...
---
<p>Just cleaning out my comment spam (Anonymous Dastard comments are filtered through an approval queue)...  All of the comment spam I've gotten since I switched to Drupal has been for online gambling/poker places.  A couple of weeks ago all of them were crude things with "ONLINE POKER" written several hundred times, every other time hyperlinked, which created something of an interesting rotating pattern that although ugly in reason for existence was a brief flash of beauty prior to pressing the delete button (Drupal shows the comment in the "Are you sure?" message).  This time each comment was presented as a semi-reasonable text of a sentence or two, with the spammy portions constrained to the subject ("Free Online Poker!") and a byline ("by Online Poker", which I thought was a funny author for a quote).  These segments of text I would assume were scraped from other blogs on the internet, and thus random and somewhat incomprehensive being taken so far out of context.  One sounded like the prologue to some physics lecture (the author was making no apologies for using lots of fourth-dimensional geometry).  Another offered an intriquing insight into our culture (and which I can only guess at where the real author may have taken this statement):</p>
