<p>I figured it was about time that I wrapped up the 2006 series of "beerrow" art, added some explanatory text, and made it look nice.  Here's the result:</p>

</a></div>
<p>I had gotten into the habit of collecting bottle caps because we were
doing some "interior decorating" with them at the Fraternity House.&nbsp;
When I went to my internship in Redmond in the Summer of 6, I found that I had a
hard time just tossing the caps away and started setting them on the
post next to the door.&nbsp; What resulted, the "beerow" was a unique work of art that I was a little proud of, so I decided to take a couple of photos before I tossed the caps at the end of my internship.&nbsp; After that I decided that I wanted to keep collecting these unique touchstones in my life as both art and memory.<br> ... <a href='http://www.tabblo.com/studio/stories/shared/14027/gxnd0lyrz7k3hju'>See my Tabblo&gt;</a>
