<p>More incentive to move one state north for grad/post-grad work.  IU Bloomington, in addition to being the nearest school that continues to have a respectable Linguistics department, is also the current home of Edward Castronova, one of the most interesting modern Economists, and the <a href="http://cssw1.org/overview.php">Center for the Study of Synthetic Worlds</a>, which sounds precisely like the academic playground I would most prefer to try.  The Center is throwing its first conference at the end of September, and I would love to attend (Bloomington is within "easy" driving distance, too), but I just can't afford the $500 attendance fee and I'm just a poor under-grad...  [semi-sarcasm]what would I have to offer such a prestigious collection of academics and industry?[/semi-sarcasm]</p>
