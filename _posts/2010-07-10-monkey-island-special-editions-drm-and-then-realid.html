title: On Monkey Island Special Editions, DRM and then The RealID Fiasco...
---
<p>Some small bits and pieces a bit longer than <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/16360461594">gurgles</a> and hopefully
quite a bit less than my usual posts in scale, but still blogworthy. I
could describe the interconnectedness of the disparate topics (winding
from adventure game controls to DRM to trolls and how to deal with
them), but instead I'll offer an achievable to anyone willing to stitch
some or all of it together themselves.</p>
<div class="section" id="direct-control-in-adventure-games">
<h1>Direct Control in Adventure Games</h1>
<p>As loyal fanboy, I of course acquired <em>LeChuck's Revenge: Monkey Island
2: Special Edition</em>.</p>
<p>One of things that got hyped in the build up for LR:MI2:SE was the
addition of &quot;direct control&quot; for Guybrush, as opposed to
point-and-click--based pathfinding. For the third time in the series
(following EMI and TMI), and the first time in a 2D entry in the series,
there are now controls to left-stick (or &quot;WASD&quot;) your way around.</p>
<p>I still remember the great debates on the subject around the time that
EMI was released (which were a shadow of the longer ones preceding <em>Grim
Fandango</em>, of course).</p>
<p>I find it interesting which adventure game fans believe which control
scheme is preferable. In playing LR:MI2:SE I've been using a 360
controller (although I own it this time on the PC, via Steam), primarily
because I've been playing it on my larger flat screen second monitor.</p>
<p>The control scheme for adventure games has swung back and forth between
both poles for far longer than gamers often seem to remember. Certainly
in the Golden Age of the 90's all of the majors used point-and-click,
but that wasn't always the case. I think it is easily forgotten that the
early AGI and SCI games from Sierra used direct control, with joystick
support even. (They also had often parsers, what a wonderfully classic
control scheme that was.)</p>
<p>Given the number of classics across both control schemes I feel it is
high time to have a moratorium on the debate of which scheme is
superior. We should be happy with whichever one makes the most sense for
the game, or developer, at hand. In the best of times, maybe we'll
even get both schemes in one shiny package, just like LR:MI2:SE
delivers.</p>

<div class="section" id="whoever-thought-that-treating-customers-like-criminals-was-a-good-idea">
<h1>Whoever thought that treating customers like criminals was a good idea?</h1>
<p>It needs not much elaboration, but trying to play one of them newfangled
blue laser discs on PC with a drive that can supposedly play them is
damn near impossible. It reminds me of the early days of DVD. (Yeah, I'm
the kind of idiot that likes a general purpose device that can handle
multiple tasks including film watching. The first DVD player I owned was
also PC drive.) It's even worse than the current state of DVD on Linux,
as bad as that is...</p>
<p>The problem is that in order to keep the content &quot;safe&quot; from &quot;criminals&quot;
everything is flaky and you never can tell (and there's nobody to ask
for troubleshooting help that seems to have a clue, either) whatever the
hell the root cause is. Perhaps it might be:</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>Bugs in the software (most of which is overpriced)</li>
<li>Bugs in the hardware</li>
<li>Inclement weather</li>
<li>Bugs in the disc</li>
<li>Failure to pay your proper blood sacrifices to the film industry</li>
<li>Bugs in the software on the disc (hi, Java!)</li>
<li>The correct operation of the &quot;iPatch&quot; detection technology (arr!)</li>
<li>All of the Above</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the thing that weirds me the most out:</p>
<p>From time to time my player software has a bad habit of crashing. For
instance, today I made the &quot;silly mistake&quot; of trying to close the
program. I had watched 20 minutes of a film before deciding to have
dinner then finish the film on a different device.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes after the program has crashed, my drive stops
responding. The eject button doesn't work, Windows' eject menu item
doesn't work. The drive stops spinning and stops even attempting to read
anything. Eventually Windows starts to think the drive has been
disconnected.</p>
<p>I can't get the drive to respond at all until I've shutdown the system,
let it cool, then bring it back up.</p>
<p>Everything about that seems broken to me. Why is the player software so
prone to crashing when it costs so much? Why does it seem that the
software crash happens to crash the hardware, rather than the much less
surprising reverse? Why do I feel that this possibly is the &quot;correct
course of action&quot; on some specification document somewhere?</p>
<p>That'll show some imaginary pirates somewhere: lock the device so that
it no longer functions until the proper authorities get there. It's not
like someone might try to watch actual films in the device.</p>
<p>I haven't even figured out how to approach the subject with support
people: is this a software problem or a hardware problem? I honestly
have no idea.</p>

<div class="section" id="don-t-feed-the-trolls">
<h1>Don't Feed the Trolls</h1>
<p>I've gurgled plenty about Activision Blizzard's RealID fiasco and I'm
glad it is mostly over. I am a bit sad that more people didn't take the
fiasco as an opportunity to join my not-very-organized &quot;boycott&quot; of the
industry's current top evil publisher.</p>
<p>Most of what I could say has been said more effectively in the last few
days by people that have more at stake in the battle than I ever will.
What I want to point out on my blog is that I <strong>highly</strong> disagree with
the <em>supposed</em> prime motivation for Activision Blizzard's attempted
stupid community-melting blunder: to fight trolls.</p>
<p>First of all, this motivation was obviously a lie. Actiblizzardo
obviously wants to do a roundabout on Facebook (and Xbox Live and Steam,
and just about every other social network out there) and bootstrap their
own behemoth on WoW and Starcraft coattails. That's a fine motivation,
but it sounds a lot more evil when you try to bury your real intentions
in a cloud of smoke (and below some of the worst community management
decision making <em>ever</em>; do their suits even use the internet?).</p>
<p>More importantly, I think it is generally unhealthy in <em>any</em> community
to make any far-reaching decision whose prime motivation is to fight
trolls. The one and only true law of dealing with internet trolls--- do
not feed them. (SFW view from Wikipedia on the law of <a class="reference external" href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/What_is_a_troll%3F#Not_feeding_the_trolls">not feeding the
trolls</a>
and NSFW troll's eye view of <a class="reference external" href="http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Don't_feed_the_trolls">don't feed the trolls</a>, which also
reminds us that one man's troll is often another's spirited provocateur
of justice.) Going out to specifically fight trolls just tends to give
them a lot more food, a lot faster. I learned this lesson many times
over in my young whippersnapper days.</p>
<p>Actiblizzardo's proposed RealID forums where every warlock knows each
other poster's truename is the equivalent of proposing to nuke
underground-dwelling creatures with orbital strikes. There is going to
be a ton of cross-fire and collateral damage and in the end you'll find
out that you wind up bringing closer to the surface the even worse creatures
that lurk even further down.</p>
<p>(For an enjoyable reenactment of this very desperation strategy and how
brazenly it fails, may I suggest the <em>Gears of War</em> series? Also, for
those that did not know the plot of Gears, or never realized that the
story is all about how stupid Sera's humanity is: you are welcome. I
think I won an achievable here for connecting Activision Blizzard's
bad decision to analogy with the downfall of the human colony Sera. Much
more fitting to use a game reference when talking about games than the
<em>Lord of the Rings</em> analogy I had planned for a disclaimer I
decided to skip.)</p>
