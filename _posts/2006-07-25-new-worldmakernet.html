<p>Now that I've got comments up <em>(and now working)</em> I thought I might comment a bit on the crazy technology going on.  I've really embraced the &quot;Web 2.0&quot; hype for this roll out...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tags as main organizing concept</li>
<li>Photo hosting by <a class="reference external" href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a></li>
<li>Spam tracking by <a class="reference external" href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a></li>
<li>Comment tracking by <a class="reference external" href="http://cocomment.com">coComment</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of this in <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> using <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>.  I've never had so much power to build in connections to such neat stuff in as fast of a time.</p>
<p>I hope to post my codebase as open source shortly.  Mostly I'm just planning to get a few more key pieces into &quot;Darcsforge&quot;.</p>
