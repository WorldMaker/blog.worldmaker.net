title: On Receiving Gifts
---

<p>I only have about half a verse so far:  (feel free to sing along)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">'tis the season for depression, fa la la la la, la la la la</div>
<div class="line">time for bathetic introspection, fa la la la la, la la la la</div>
</div>
<p>So my father has become well known at this point for having a difficulty in receiving large gifts.  It's something that has bugged my mom for a while now.  My brother this year had a long list of things that he wanted, but had a hard time narrowing it down and ultimately decided that he didn't really <em>need</em> any of it, and nuked his entire list and announced that he didn't need anything and he didn't need to be given anything, but he was working on getting a new car with my dad and that is all he really needed.  My mom was angry because how could she buy him gifts he didn't tell her what he wanted?   I joked that he was becoming more like dad.  But it was me, ironically I guess, that really ended up like my dad this year.</p>
<p>My mom gave me, as her big surprise gift to me this year, a new car stereo.  I was certainly surprised.  I reacted poorly.  I reacted like my dad might have, I guess.  Sure, I might <em>want</em> a new stereo for my car (it has only a broken cassette deck), but I certainly wouldn't use one and I have more pressing car-related needs than that.  I don't use my car hardly at all.  A car is a vehicle, a means, not an end, and most of my driving lately has been to and from the bus stop.  Sure, I have a crappy radio, but I also have crappy speakers.  If I were to have a new stereo installed I'd need new speakers and ultimately I'd have more money invested in audio equipment than value left in the car itself.</p>
<p>I expressed jealousy that my sister has now had 2 car stereos paid for by my mom, but I didn't mean that I wanted a car stereo...  I was expressing my jealousy that my parents have spent at least more than quadruple what they spent on my car on my sister's <em>cars</em> and <em>stereos</em>.  In the time that I've had my car, which I emptied my savings account to pay for half of, my sister has gone through two cars, my brother has gotten a new car, and my parents traded for two new cars themselves.  I officially have the cheapest and oldest car around.  My car is the only one lacking in power locks and power windows, which I could certainly use more than a new stereo.  Those would be really nice to have.</p>
<p>But I haven't complained!  Like I said, I don't use my car much, at least not by choice, and I don't need much.  I'm satisfied with what I have right now, and I don't mind scraping together the money myself to buy myself my next car.  Maybe I'll even buy an actual &quot;new&quot; car, when I get the chance, instead of spending months in the classifieds and used car lots.  I'm perfectly fine with that.</p>
<p>But I feel bad for not reacting with joy when my mom tried to give me a new car stereo to at least make my car that small bit nicer and more homely.  I feel bad for letting that hit my existing seasonal depression wave and spiral into a heavier depression this week.  I figured I'd write something about this just to get it out of my head.  That weird catharsis in public expressions of private pains.  I don't think that I ruined Christmas, but I did put a small damper on my mom's joy.  I know that she knows that I love her and can only hope that that is enough.</p>
<p>I'm worried about myself, I guess.  I don't know what I'm doing sitting here trying to reevaluate what's going on rather than trying to get some actual work done or get some actual relaxation time in.  I have a Starbucks application in my pocket and I've been thinking about dropping out of school.  I don't know what the best course of action here is...  I don't think I'm going to shake things up that drastically, but I don't know what I'm doing right now.  I need to get out more.  I need to do something different.  I don't know what.  It's been a long December.</p>
