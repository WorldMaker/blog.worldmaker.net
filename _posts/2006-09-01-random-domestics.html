<p>I lost one of my bottle openers...  the LEO (Louisville Eccentric Observer) swag bottle opener fell off my key chain for what appears the last time, as I haven't seen it in a couple of days.  It shall be missed.</p>
<p>I have a large stack of bowls in my apartment.  My school set has 4, now somewhat chipped, bowls.  The three bedroom apartment in the summer (same complex, same corporate housing supplied furnishings) had only 4 bowls for the three of us (I think we finally asked and got a few more towards the end).  This two bedroom apartment has an excellent number of bowls for just me and even more spoons...</p>
