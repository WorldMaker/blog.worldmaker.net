title: Mexican Penguin

<p>More than anything else, <i>Mexican Penguin</i> was the cornerstone of DRAGONzine.  It was my first attempt at a novel length work and at releasing a serial work.  Because I had written the first couple chapters before I started my DRAGONzine attempt it was guaranteed material to use to pick up slack and fill an issue.</p>
