title: City of Heroes Issue 11

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/16400">City of Heroes Issue 11</a> is tempting me to play the game again, at least for a little while.  Not because I care about old missed badges and only a little because I want to play missions that I missed...  Mostly just because I'm a sucker for time-travel stuff, even this sort of cheesy B-Movie style madness...</p>
