title: The Problem of Work
---
<p>I filled out an application for the Google Summer of Code initiative, and have been reading/responding to some of the messages in the discussion group for it.  It is an exciting thing.  (Google is planning to sponsor nearly a million dollars of new Open Source development from College students, partly to entice more into joining the Open Source community in the long term.)</p>

<p>It's surprising to me, though, that I'm really not all that excited or incentivized about the money.  I'm not desperate for money anymore; I've slaked that thirst.  I really wouldn't have noticed that if it weren't for following the discussion group where I see some kids complaining about not being able to compete for the money and how much "age-ism" that is, and I remember when I was like that.</p>

<p>My major incentive has been the possible that with money involved in a contract I might be able to claim this with the co-op and avoid at least one semester of working for a giant uncaring corporation.  To me, that is the real excitement about this initiative is that it puts up a monetary bounty to go out and do some of the philanthropy that I was planning to do anyway.  I'm still planning to do as much as I can this Summer, with or without the stipend, but now the prospect arises that I might get a few bucks for the philanthropy that I think needs to get done.  I've always known that there are a few groups I could go begging to once the concept was proven and the costs of running it got to be too much for me, but until SoC I saw no real prospect/need for charter funding.</p>

<p>Anyway, speaking of the project...   Support Open/Free Mythoi:  Read the <a href="http://www.mythoi.com/manifesto">Manifesto</a>.</p>
