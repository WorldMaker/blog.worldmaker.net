<p>Awesome.  Proof that more writers should collaborate.  Set in a parallel version of Heinlein's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_History">Future History</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Corridor/8611/rah2.htm">Detailed timeline of the Future History</a>) with some of Heinlein's &quot;juvenile&quot; elements and recent events (9/11, war in the middle east) folded in.  (Then further skewed by a major event in the book.)  It's a fun, classic space opera (with some &quot;romance&quot;) that begs the question of why Robinson has not written one before...  Having read quite a bit of both writers, I think it does read more like Spider, but I like the feel of Robinson's writing (bad puns and all) around Heinlein's world building.</p>
