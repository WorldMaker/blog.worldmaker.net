<p>Well, I was an idiot and used the auto-upgrade thing to upgrade.  I said I wasn't going to do this the last time I royally messed things up, and this time the shit has hit the fan even harder.  Serves me right for attempting to do something at midnight, who knows what I was thinking just now when I clicked the necessary buttons.  We just haven't reached the day when web apps can smartly upgrade themselves no matter how much people try to pretend we do.  Anyway, I'll work on this stuff tomorrow.  In the meantime, my apologies for the semi-working install.</p>
