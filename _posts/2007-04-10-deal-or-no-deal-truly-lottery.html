<p>In case anyone cares:  I just finished a 25-page paper in which I showed statistically that the banker has an impact on the results of a game of <em>Deal or No Deal</em>, but the contestants <strong>do not</strong>.  I'll post a PDF or XPS of the paper tomorrow, perhaps.  I primarily wasn't testing contestants, so it is possible that my random sampling of contestants was biased and there exists contestants for which there is a statistically significant difference and all of my participants just happened to be very equally matched.  I'm a little doubtful, though.</p>
