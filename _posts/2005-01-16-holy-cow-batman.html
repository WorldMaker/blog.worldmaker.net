<p>Doing some random reading on Virtual World economies via <a href="http://www.juliandibbell.com/">Julian Dibbell</a> (who is doing a Stanford seminar with Lawrence Lessig on Law and Virtual Worlds which sounds interesting) and came across <a href="http://www.cohtreasures.com/">COH Treasures</a>.  I've mentioned it before, but I played City of Heroes for about 3 months before getting bored with it and quitting.  At the time I quit I had 1.4 million influence (COH's currency) on hand which I traded to the supergroup I was in for them to invest in younger superheroes.  My jaw dropped to learn that to buy that much influence via COH Treasures would cost: $6,930.00.</p>
