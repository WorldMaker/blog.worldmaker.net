<p>Ben's Opening Monologue, <em>Full Throttle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Whenever I smell asphalt, I think of Maureen.</div>
<div class="line">That's the last sensation I had before I blacked out:</div>
<div class="line">that thick smell of asphalt.</div>
<div class="line"><br></div>

<div class="line">And the first thing I saw when I woke up was her face.</div>
<div class="line">She said she'd fix my bike, free.</div>
<div class="line">No strings attached.</div>
<div class="line">I should have known then that things were never that simple.</div>
<div class="line"><br></div>
<div class="line">Yeah.  When I think of Maureen I think of two things:</div>
<div class="line">asphalt and trouble.</div>

<p class="last">June's Round Table invites us to explore a memorable character
relationship in a game.  I use it as an opportunity to dissect said
relationship and then make bold claims as I synthesize the dissection
with a number of threads of ideas that I've been contemplating this
month.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Full Throttle</em> is the first of Tim Schafer's relationship-centric
LucasArts adventure games.  I think <em>Grim Fandango</em> is superior, but
<em>Full Throttle</em> is one of the shortest adventure games from LucasArts
making it perfect for deconstruction.  The entire game can be played
easily in about six to eight hours and an experienced player or someone
following a walkthrough without doing further exploration can do it in
four hours.</p>
<p>I certainly recommend grabbing a copy from a friend or even a strange
acquaintance.  It plays perfectly well in <a class="reference external" href="http://scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> and on just about any
platform you could want to run it on.  Considering LucasArts'
indifference to their own classic properties you probably shouldn't feel
all that guilty if to borrow the game you engage the help of some
devious Seeder utilizing Mr. Cohen's patented Torrent-brand Æthertube
Data Cross-Packers.  Come back when you've played it...</p>

<p>So let's deconstruct!  <em>Full Throttle</em> is centered around the
relationship between Ben and Maureen.  It's right there front and center
in the opening monologue that serves as both a tone-setter and something
of a flash-forward foreshadowing the way things go down in the next few
scenes.</p>
<p>The relationship thus begins in the first cutscene.  The development of
the relationship happens mostly in cutscenes with three major dialogue
trees in between.  One dialogue tree is purely perfunctory, establishing
a small series of goals.  The second tree is an obstacle with a simple
"key piece of information" puzzle that requires only that one recall the
last words of a dying man.  The final tree is just about as perfunctory
as the first, and also about setting a series of goals.</p>
<p>The relationship centers the game, it binds the game's story arc, it is
the hub from which most of the game's puzzles branch from.  The
relationship doesn't add much to the gameplay beyond setting the quests,
and there is no gameplay consequences on the relationship itself.</p>
<p>Deconstructed thusly, it sounds as if this relationship doesn't make for
a very good game.  Maureen sounds like little more than the standard
"fetch-quest NPC".  So much of the relationship is in the things that
are harder to deconstruct: dialogue writing and voice acting, animation
and cinematography.  I would argue that even as the imperfect younger
sibling to <em>Grim Fandango</em>'s <em>Casablanca</em>-inspired relationships, the
relationship between Maureen and Ben in <em>Full Throttle</em> is still one of
the most meaningful relationships in gaming history.</p>

<p>I don't think that the game would have been improved by increasing
"relationship gameplay".  Relationships are generally not games, and the
gameplay that we see used to quantify or symbolize relationship
development, such as "dating sims" and "escort missions", are generally
hollow shells compared to the power of a "traditional" story telling
methods: cutscenes, dialogue, good writing, good voice acting.</p>
<p>I point all of this out in order to synthesize a number of threads that
I've been reading and thinking about recently.  I've been thinking about
the "gameplay über alles" mentality that seems to be gripping recent
game theory.  You can't throw out the "cutscene bath water" without
losing more than a few babies.  I think that <em>Full Throttle</em> eloquently
serves as an example for that, when deconstructed into its component
parts things don't sound that "fun" or "interesting", but the sum of the
parts continues to shine over a decade after the game's release. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>
Good writing, good animation, good voice acting are all still qualities
that carry over from other media.  That doesn't change with
interactivity, with gameplay.  Instead it should <em>meld</em>.</p>
<p>I've heard several times lately that "gaming is a <strong>new</strong> medium" and my
response is "no, gaming is a <strong>young</strong>, impetuous medium".  Gaming seems
weirdly determined in this adolescent stage to forget its own 40-years
of "youth" (if we restrict solely to "video games", and longer than that
should we be wont to merge with the much longer history of card, board
and (pen and paper) roleplaying games), much less to spend much time
contemplating the lessons learned in past media.  There are over 100
years of movie experience to learn from.  There are over a 1000 years of
plays and novels.  Even gaming's prime technology, "interactivity" isn't
anywhere as new as gaming theorists give it credit:  There has been
improv theater for at least as long as there has been comedians, if not
nearly as long as there have been actors.  Board and card games have a
long history of their own.  Even the first storytellers in prehistory of
man probably knew how to spin a good story to the ears of their
audience.</p>

<p>If computer gaming/video gaming has a true strength, it's not
interactivity or gameplay, it's the ability to integrate and harmonize
so many other media and so much of the history of humanity's experience.
Interactivity and gameplay are only one facet in a potentially much
greater whole, and we are still in the early alchemical phases.  One of
these days we may start to truly learn the reactivities of our many
constituent elements.</p>
<p>The relationship of Ben and Maureen is just one example in a pantheon of
them where the relationship works with minimal 'gameplay' and almost in
spite of the gameplay itself.  Yet as a strong central story in and of
itself it acts as a glue binding the gameplay of <em>Full Throttle</em> into a
fuller whole.  Perhaps more interesting in this day, what the
relationship of Ben and Maureen has the most to teach us is how much we
have still to learn of the relationship between storytelling and
gameplay, and the relationship between gaming as a medium and its own
history and its future potential.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
