<div class=Section1>

<p class=CommonText>The room was rather small; it had one desk, a plasma lamp<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
and a Galactinet Reality Couch (GRC)<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2'
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>
that doubled as a bed. Basically, it
was like any other of the Volis bedrooms to be found in the Pazerion, with one
small difference, this room had a letter of Recommendation signed and sealed by
First Volus Ortrius himself, framed on the back wall.</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet grimaced at the horrible Mauve carpet and then spoke,
"What's with all the Blue?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis shrugged, "Uh... I think it has to do with the... er...
Actually I have no idea."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet sat down on the desk chair and Jasis sat on the GRC,
careful not to accidentally activate it.</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Here's the deal, we have a corporate battle that is
threatening to undermine the Economic structure of the entire Tri-Galactic
Area," Deet stated.</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis shrugged, "Oh, the NEOTINTWURP thing... The BDT in the
lounge was showcasing 'Interview with a Ampire', the PENGUIN exclusive..."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet sighed, "Is there anything you can't find out? This thing just started yesterday."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis smiled, "Well, I don't know 'How many fish could a
fish fish if a fish could ship fish by the barrel?'"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet stared at Jasis, "What?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis shrugged, "It's just an old Fish Day Tongue Rhyme I've
always wondered about."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet relaxed, "Oh, like 'How many monk fish does it take to
make a carp of red salmon on a cold winter day if monkeys were easy to find?'"</p>

<p class=CommonText>"None. The monkey
would slap the monk fish," Jasis answered, "Anyway, what does Azeroth want <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>us</i> to do?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet shrugged, "We need to find out what Yamma-Hamma-Mamma
is planning... Something looks like one
of those two may break a corporate law, and Azeroth doesn't want it on its
watch."</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Then why don't you just contact the GSO?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet sighed, pounding her hand the desk; "Don't you think
we've tried? GSO is not responding...
some think that YHM or NEOTINTWURP may have broken into GSO..."</p>

<p class=CommonText>"What does NEOTINTWURP stand for?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet shrugged, "The Neotintwurpish something or other... I don't think anyone knows other than the
guys at NEOTINTWURP. Why?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Oh, sorry, just curious... Anyway, shouldn't we be getting
on our way?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet furrowed her brow, "Where?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>"NEOTINTWURP of course," and then he added to himself, "I
have to figure out what it stands for."</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Reflader Manager smiled a toothy grin at his staff,
showing his reptilian forked tongue. The one human flinched, unconsciously, perhaps from ingrained
instincts. The other Refladers laughed
and smirked.</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Manager spoke, his reptilian accent trained away, "We
shall do what our ancestors tried long ago, and this time," his air sacs swelled
with pride, "WE SHALL NOT FAIL!"</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Manager walked to the back of the room where the lone
human sat. "Thanks to this pitiful," the word came out sounding like the most
vile word to ever have to touched the ears of any living creature, "excuse for
a human has thankfully provided us with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>key</i>
to destroying humans once and for all time. We shall destroy them from the inside out by following their own <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>laughable</i> rules."</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Manager paced back to the front of the table. He motioned to his enforcers; "You may kill
him now."</p>

<p class=CommonText>"We had a deal you stupid... you stupid <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>lizard</i>."</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Yes, and now you have learned an important life... er... death
lesson that you shall not forget: Never trust a Reflader. Good day. Oh, and guards, take him outside, we just polished the wood paneling."</p>

<p class=CommonText>In the light of the twilight of the lone sun, the HQ of
NEOTINTWURP was fairly plain. A simple
building design that was almost ostentatious at its universal plainness. The door, a simple, plain door, was the only
disturbance in a flat wall. Jasis
opened it and he and Deet entered. A
lone secretary sat inside the entrance. There were no doors to be seen, and the room was a plain all-powerful
egg white.</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Ugh. I don't like
this room, Jasis."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis said nothing and approached the secretary who was
just as plain as the building she worked in.</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Excuse me, is there anyone I can talk to about
NEOTINTWURP's business practices?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>The secretary flitted her eyes, "You can talk to me,
shugah. There ain't anyone else in the building at this late hour."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet brought herself forward, "Listen you 'TWURP! We need to talk to your boss or manager or
something, now! I've got full weight of
the Azerothian Corporation, and he--my partner is a member of the Volis."</p>

<p class=CommonText>The secretary slumped back into her chair, "Okay, fine..."
she spoke into an intercom device, "Sir, I've got two... business people
here... they need to talk with you."</p>

<p class=CommonText>A piece of the wall began moving until it revealed an
Entranceway that was highly decorated and a huge contrast to the plain wall
around it. As Jasis and Deet entered
the secretary called out behind them, "He's really nice when you get to know
him!"</p>

<p class=CommonText>The office was sparsely furnished, yet highly
decorated. The desk was covered in
papers and a swivel chair was facing to the wall, away from Jasis and Deet.</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Yes, what do you want, I am very busy!"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis smiled and approached the desk; "Sir, Deet Halden and
I represent Galacticred Finance and Returns, a small one-planet business, and
we would like some insight into your business."</p>

<p class=CommonText>The businessman did not turn around, "Under what
authority?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis smiled, "Under Galactic Standards Organization Law,
Section 15, Paragraph 5, Right to Accounting/Moral Background in
Business-to-Business dealing."</p>

<p class=CommonText>A distinct click emerged as the wall behind Jasis and Deet
closed. The chair swiveled revealing a
Reflader. Deet gasped, Jasis smiled.</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Reflader spoke, accent free, "So, you want business
info... I'll give it. NEOTINWURP is an agency for which we shall
take over your computer systems with our Operating System... thus taking over your entire society!"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis just shrugged, "So? It'll never work."</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Reflader spoke gently, "It already has... Every system has switched to NEOTINTWURP
after being... annoyed by the paranoid
Yamma-Hamma-Mamma server company."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis reached inside his jacket and pulled out a small,
handheld hyperbeacon. He flipped one
switch. Nothing seemed to happen and
the Reflader laughed. Then an Intercom
blared, "Security Breach! All systems
have shutdown NEOTINTWURP using hidden backdoor."</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Reflader stuck his tongue out. "Ha. You may have deactivated our system, but you shall not escape."</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Reflader pressed a button on his desk an instant after
Jasis pressed the second switch on the hyperbeacon, "That is all I needed to
know, Thanks!" he yelled as he and Deet were pulled into hyperspace.</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Announcement to all Members of the GSO board. Matters Reflader related have made necessary
a rescheduling of our annual review. In
the light of recent matters, we must rewrite our codes and laws that have
lasted these few centuries to be sure and keep humans dominant in the
Tri-Galactic Area."</p>

<p class=CommonText>The Director of GSO Services, Frank Benjamin, sighed. He signaled the broadcast engineer and the
hyperwave signal was cut. "Well, let's
get ready for a long year."</p>

<p class=CommonText>"Galacticred Finance and Returns?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis shrugged, "My father runs Galacticred Finance and
Returns."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet always felt exasperated around Jasis, "So, you didn't
want to be an accountant?"</p>

<p class=CommonText>Jasis smiled, "I felt that the corporate bindings were a
good system, I just felt that my life would be better spent doing something...
useful."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet stood up, "One last thing, is it really
one-planet? I think I may have heard of
it..."</p>

<p class=CommonText>"No, actually, its about thirty or forty, maybe... but you
better have heard of it, it was the company that... er... coined the Galacticred,
excuse the pun, and does accounting for even Azeroth... your paycheck should have the Galacticred F and R logo on the
back."</p>

<p class=CommonText>Deet pulled out her last paycheck from her jacket pocket
and stared at the back, sighed, and then left.</p>
