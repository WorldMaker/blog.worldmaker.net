title: 'Hackety Hack: Silverlight?'
---
<p>Hey, remember when I was talking <a class="reference external" href="/2007/apr/28/hackety-hack-do-code-back/">about how the Xbox 360 is almost, just about, a killer platform for teaching coding to kids</a>?  Remember how I thought it was possibly just around the corner?  There are interesting new twists in this saga this week...</p>
<p>Following the coat-tails of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> 1.0 Beta, Microsoft has just released the first public alpha version of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> 1.1.  Crazy, huh?  The big difference is the one I had been expecting for some time: Silverlight 1.1 includes a cross-platform Compact Framework-like mini-CLR.  Here's the kicker of a huge surprise twist: Silverlight 1.1 also includes the first official alpha release of the <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/archive/2007/04/30/a-dynamic-language-runtime-dlr.aspx">Dynamic Language Runtime</a>.  IronPython (2.0), IronRuby, and Managed JScript are all going to be officially supported Silverlight languages.</p>
<p>First of all, I am curious as to how far away, then, DLR for the 360 is...</p>
<p>Second, with this announcement I think Silverlight becomes a potential killer platform for teaching coding skills with dynamic languages in the Hackety Hack vein: easily deployable via the web (small cross-platform toolkit <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>), powerful &quot;real&quot; languages, good young people-friendly sandboxing...</p>
<p>XAML isn't a bad alternative to XHTML, either.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>I realize the small exception the Microsoft still hasn't promised a Linux version of Silverlight...  Hopefully that's an oversight that will be corrected shortly.  Just to start further rumors, because I can, I have a sneaking suspicion that the Xbox and Zune may show up as Silverlight platforms as well...</td></tr>
