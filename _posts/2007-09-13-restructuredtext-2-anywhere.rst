title: reStructuredText 2 Anywhere

`reStructuredText 2 Anywhere <http://rst2a.com/>`_ is an advocacy group and friendly cloud service for reStructuredText (reST or RST).  reST has become one of my common writing formats at this point (all of my blog posts, issue tracker posts, source control (revision) comments for the last while (including this one) have been in reST) and rst2a is a pretty neat idea.  The site has two major components: 1) It has a simple writing box to write an reST document and get back stylish HTML or PDF, alongside an reST quick reference.  2) A style gallery to promote interesting styles for reST such as nice PDF document styles.  I'll probably make more use of the second part of the site, personally, but I might send people to the first part when I need them to work with reST.
