title: Exhausted
---
<p>Spent most of this week in transit. Today I'm exhausted and a tiny bit jet lagged. I went to Palo Alto's California Avenue area and interviewed with a small startup in that area. I learned much from the trip, but unfortunately I did not learn some of the things that I had been hoping to learn coming into this week.</p>
<p>I wish I had had the money to have invested in making the trip seem ultimately more worthwhile with respect to my considerable &quot;geographical disadvantage&quot;. (I've decided to refrain from ranting, at the time being, about my hatred of the airlines and the absurdity of their hub layouts and pricing schemes.) Certainly, I particularly wish I had had the chance to spend more time going &quot;door to door&quot; with some of the other companies in the Bay Area, particularly the San Rafael area, in one longer trip.</p>
