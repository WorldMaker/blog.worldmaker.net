<p>It was only two weeks that I realized I hadn't paid enough attention to a case and what appeared to be a an average everyday CD purchase revealed itself as a <a class="reference external" href="/2006/aug/13/copy-control">monstrous non-standard beast</a>.  Now, I've met a couple of DRM engineers, and most of them have their hearts in the right place, even if I don't agree with how their products are used.  In this case, I was given a CD that was just about useless in my personal music ecology:  I couldn't use the music on more than one computer (my desktop is my main stereo, but I leave the Quiddity behind when I'm here in Redmond).  I couldn't use the music on my portable audio device (Neuros).  I couldn't store the music in the format I preferred (not as big of a problem, but still a personal irritance).</p>
<p>I found a program just now to help me make <em>fair use</em> of the Windows Media files that the fake CD did allow me to have.  (Albeit it is against the contract that was worst EULA I've ever seen, that was a required click-through in the awful fake CD.  Apparently Virgin's lawyers don't like fair use.)</p>
