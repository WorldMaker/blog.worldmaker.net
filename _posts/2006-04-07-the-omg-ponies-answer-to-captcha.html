<p>Personally, I hate Captchas (those Rorschach tests given when trying to subscribe or post to so many websites nowadays in order to fight spam).  A person with the handle of Oli came up with a much more radical idea: <a href="http://www.thepcspy.com/articles/security/the_cutest_humantest_kittenauth">The Kitten Test</a>.  Can you pick kittens out of a set of cute animals?  <a href="http://www.thepcspy.com/kittenauthtest">Try it here</a>.</p>
