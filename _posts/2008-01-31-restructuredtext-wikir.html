title: On reStructuredText, Wikir

<p>I switched to reStructuredText (reST) about a year ago as a preferred formatting style.  (I have long, weird history here, including one that I wrote from scratch, by hand.)  ReST has a number of unique points and has a very interesting overly-optimistic (almost over-engineered) design.  The primary focus is that the ASCII markup should be relatively unobtrusive, and I've yet to see a reST document that was difficult to read.  Much of the markup looks relatively &quot;natural&quot; in a text document.  Beyond that, reST has a powerful backend system that is built to support any number of output formats.  The same reST documents can be output to HTML documentation, LaTeX/PDF &quot;paper&quot; documentation, or many other things you can want.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rst2a.com/">RST2A</a> is a good advocacy site for more of an idea of why reST is different and some of what you can do with it.</p>
<p>An interesting new development, to me at least, is <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/wikir/">Wikir</a>, which brings backend support to generate Wiki-formatting-style documents from reST sources, which was originally built to allow a project on Google Code to autogenerate Wiki documents (so they show up on Google Code's wiki section) from existing reST documents.  It's almost funny to convert one ASCII-based markup style to another, but it certainly could be useful.</p>
