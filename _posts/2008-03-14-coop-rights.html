title: On Coop Rights
---
<p>Ozymandias has been working on compiling the best version he can of <a class="reference external" href="http://ozymandias.com/archive/2008/03/13/the-co-op-gaming-bill-of-rights.aspx">The Coop Bill of Rights</a>, following Tycho's wandering into the subject earlier...  Coop gaming is in the midst of a great comeback, a defining movement in the current generation, and something that I think a lot of people are hoping to see stick around and nearly become a &quot;required&quot; feature.  Forget length or graphics, but &quot;Does it have coop?  What sort?&quot;  Hence the idea of a Bill of Rights to find a lot of good &quot;rules&quot; (of thumb, rather than of law right now) on what should and should not be required for any good coop experience.</p>
<p>I think that coop is something that really shows off if your narrative design really works well interactively or not.  Easy contrasts are <em>Gears of War</em> and <em>Halo 3</em>...  there are some key narrative moments that my brother and I can talk about in Gears that there aren't parallels of in Halo because I think Epic did a much better job at pushing more of the narrative design into the level design and making sure more of it &quot;popped&quot; in coop just as well (if not better) than in solo play.</p>
<p>Not to say that either has the best approach because there is still a lot to do in order to really draw cool and interesting narratives out of coop structures.</p>
<p>Anyway, just as interesting out of this discussion is my introduction to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.co-optimus.com/">Co-Optimus</a>, which is a site that has dedicated itself almost entirely to coop gaming across all platforms.  I think if anything, such a &quot;fan club&quot; bodes well for the future of cooperative gaming.</p>
