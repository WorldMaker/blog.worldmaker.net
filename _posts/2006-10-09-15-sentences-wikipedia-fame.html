title: 15 Sentences of Wikipedia Fame

<p>Beyond <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=WorldMaker">some fairly mediocre contributions</a>, I haven't made a huge dent yet in the English Wikipedia, and I've mentioned that before.  One of the things I noticed a while back, but think is pretty cool is that the Spanish Wikipedia contributors have incorporated my ideas from <a class="reference external" href="/2006/feb/09/the-django-framework-architecture/">my discussion on Django Architecture</a> into the <a class="reference external" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django">Spanish Wikipedia article on the Django Web Framework</a>.  I've been getting a fair amount of hits from that usage.</p>
<p>As a note to myself, and a potential way to guide potential contributions, I should join the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Louisville">Louisville WikiProject</a> when I get a chance...</p>
