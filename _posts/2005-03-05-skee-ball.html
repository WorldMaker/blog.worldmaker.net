title: Skee Ball
---
<p>Last night was a social with AOPi at Chuck E. Cheese.  As usual, I spent all of my tokens at the skee ball machine.  We rallied our tickets and as a group made <a href="http://php.louisville.edu/rso/triangle/photo.php?path=2005/Summer/AOPi%20social%20032.JPG">8188 tickets</a>.  I helped put a small dent in that total, in several games of skee ball I managed 100-200 tickets.  Chuck E. Cheese is suffering from Skee Ball inflation, though, because the number of tickets a skee ball game produced just wasn't what it should have been.  I've said it before, but if anyone feels like giving me a costly present, I'd enjoy having my own <a href="http://www.gamedepot.biz/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=GD&Product_Code=44250">Skee Ball machine</a>.  (Shipping alone is around $500-$700.)</p>
