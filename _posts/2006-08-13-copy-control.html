title: On Copy Control

<p>Recently I remarked, on the rather evil &quot;Copy Control Discs&quot; (which are not, and should not be confused with, CDs):</p>
<blockquote>
DRM is not a solution.  It fails to even consider the root cause of the &quot;problem&quot;.  Welcome to the Free Market, ladies and gentlemen.  If you can't compete with &quot;Piracy&quot;, by value-added services like, for example, originality, promotions, or down home guilt appeals, then by all means go find another industry to play with.  Breaking standards and removing people's freedoms is just sad, and in a just world would never be tolerated.</blockquote>
