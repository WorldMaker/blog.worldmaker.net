title: Rushing the field...
---
There have been two big University of Louisville football games that I've watched since I started College where following the game the fans rushed the field.  In both cases I watched a good part of the game, but missed the chance to actually physically rush the field.  The first was during my Freshman year.  It was a rain-drenched victory over a then-nationally-ranked South Florida team that is still a tale I tend to tell because it helped lead me to appreciate football.

Last night was the second.  In the "biggest game ever" for the program, albeit until next week, Louisville, ranked nationally at #5 (highest ever) with an 8-0 start to the season (first since 1925 when the school was not even competing in NCAA football), defeated West Virginia, also undefeated coming into the game and ranked nationally at #3.  It was a power game between top nationally ranked teams, with not just rankings on the line but conference standings as well.

Watching the ESPN coverage, the shots of my hometown, the skyline in the background of the commentator's box, the fans rushing the field, the spectacle and the majesty of my school making a huge statement on national television in "my" stadium (where I've been when it was half full, and where I've been when it was empty, and where I've been for early Thanksgiving Dinner with friends)...  I had the largest twinge of homesickness I've had since I left home in May.  I only have a week of work left, so no use in dwelling on it, obviously.  For a moment there, however, I certainly wished to be rushing that field...
