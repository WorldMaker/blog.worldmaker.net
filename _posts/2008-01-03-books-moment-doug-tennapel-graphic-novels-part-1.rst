Just some quick mini-reviews, ordered by own my own weird reading order:

Gear
  Just fun, weird steampunk with anthropomorphic cats and dogs.

Flink
  Who doesn't want to believe that magic sasquatches roam the pacific northwest as hidden, photo-averse park rangers?  Cute-haters, that's who.  (Reminded me tangentially of the great *Futurama* episode involving the sasquatch.)

Tommysaurus Rex
  Happy fairy tale: Boy loses dog.  Boy moves to farm.  Boy discovers T-Rex.  Boy eventually grows up.

Creature Tech
  Doug has a weird neo-Gnosticism all his own and Creature Tech, so far, is the one that is the most there.  It's a funny sort of *Raiders of the Lost Ark* with space eels and mad magicians.  The gnostic elements simply add to the fantastical feel of the piece, and didn't bother me all that much.

Earthboy Jacobus
  This a cute, fantastical "triumph over evil" voyage.  There were a few things that even really piqued my interest.  It's a veiled version of Jonah and the Whale and a not-so-veiled US Marines versus the "commie" hive-minded insects tale, but the art alone is worth it.
