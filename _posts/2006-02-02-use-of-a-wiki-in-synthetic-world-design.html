title: Use of a Wiki in Synthetic World Design
---
The <a href="https://elothtes.pbwiki.com/">Epic Legends of the Hierarchs: The Elemenstor Saga Wiki</a> is a very interesting read.  See if you can remember the old television show, epic novel cycle, or the trading card game.  Of course, it is <a href="https://elothtes.pbwiki.com/Crimethink">crimethink</a> for anyone to suggest that any of those didn't actually exist and were instead figments of the imaginations of <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade (comic)</a> readers.  But, if it weren't real it would be a great example of emergent synthetic world design in Wiki form, which is something I've been positing about for a while.
