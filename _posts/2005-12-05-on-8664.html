<p>This is intended as a brief summary of <a href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/node/172">Mass Transit, Where are you?</a>, for sending as a Letter to the Editor of the local newspaper as this issue has come up in a bigger way locally.</p>

<p>On the recently discussed plan to reroute I-64 out of downtown Louisville, it is great to hear someone thinking about something radical.  The problem is that we are discussing the wrong radical plan.  I-64 is not the cause of most of our Spaghetti Junction congestion.  I-64 is not our most traveled downtown interstate.  I-64 is not the reason for the proposed downtown bridge.  If we want to talk about a radical plan to reroute an interstate, let's discuss rerouting I-65 out of central Louisville and into the west or east end!  This isn't even a new radical plan, this is the plan suggested by Kentucky's own Interstate Commissioner in the 50s and 60s, where he said his biggest mistake was the current route of I-65 and even predicted this mess we find ourselves in.</p>

<p>Here's a less radical plan:  Anyone remember the T2 project TARC was working on?  A good mass transit system, whether light rail, monorail, or subway, could help alleviate most of the intra-city traffic that currently piggy-backs on I-65 (including Airport, University, Convention Center, and Churchill Downs traffic) and remove congestion from I-65.  Perhaps we should reallocate bridge money back into this project that was originally meant to be completed by 2007, but cancelled due to lack of funds.</p>
