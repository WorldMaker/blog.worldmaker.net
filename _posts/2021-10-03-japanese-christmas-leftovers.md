title: A Recipe for Leftovers from Japanese Christmas

Something that I love is getting a chance to chat with Japanese
travelers to Kentucky. They have many reasons, obviously, but it's fun
to chat about the shared loves like bourbon (and the Japanese own a
lot of the distilleries these days), or bluegrass music, or other
reasons that makes a stop in Kentucky seem worth it, even if it is "on
the way" to a further east coast US destination such as New York. (An
amusing twist to the "flyover country" badge of dishonor we sometimes
see ourselves branded with that, rarely, but sometimes on the mental
map of some Japanese travelers Kentucky makes a good stop in the long
flights between San Francisco and New York to drink a bourbon closer
to its distillery and maybe see some sights.)

Among the stories and the reasons, I enjoy tales of Japanese
Christmas. In the 1960s in Japan the KFC franchisee there in a
somewhat desperate bid to build marketing buzz and sell a lot of
Kentucky Fried Chicken hit on the idea of selling the Americanized
brand of Christmas to the Japanese: sleigh bells, Rudolph, Santa,
giving gifts to family and loved ones, and of course America's
"traditional" Christmas dinner of a bucket of KFC to share with those
family and loved ones. It was a marketing scheme that worked and to
this day Japan associates Christmas with eleven herbs and spices and
Santa with his friend Colonel Sanders. They say Japanese Christmas is
one of the biggest, most regular sales days for KFC in the world. I
love that.

A simple recipe that I picked up on social media at some point in the
weird few years we've been having lately is what some do with the
leftovers from Japanese Christmas:

1. Add rice to your rice cooker
2. Replace the volume of water you would normally use with chicken
stock (or add chicken bouillon to the water) and a heavy splash of soy
sauce
3. Set your leftover chicken on top
4. Run your rice cooker on the usual rice cycle

It's incredibly simple, but steaming leftovers from a bucket of KFC
I've found really does seem the best way to reheat fried chicken.
Steamed like that the chicken is moist and "fall off the bone" tender.
Those eleven herbs and spices infuse the rice to make a delicious KFC
rice bowl to accompany the chicken.

In my case, I haven't been buying KFC much, despite being in Kentucky,
but instead my big craving has been Nashville Style Hot Chicken. It's
partly a Yelp event's fault but when that craving hits I usually buy a
"Family Pack for Four" from [Joella's](https://joellas.com/)
(if you are curious: Hot, with
Kickin' Gravy Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans, and the Cheerwine BBQ
sauce). That huge amount of food makes for three good days of full
plate meals, eating by myself, and a couple tenders left after all the
sides are done. For that last meal of those tenders I've been
reheating them with this "Japanese Christmas Leftovers" recipe and
it's fantastic. After a couple days of reheating chicken tenders
boring American style in a Microwave, the different in reheated
texture of the chicken steamed with rice is such a welcome and amazing
shakeup. I mostly buy tenders so there's no bone for them to fall off
of, but it's still great how the chicken flakes into chunks as you
prod with a fork while eating it in a bowl. The Nashville Hot spices
with their heat infuse the rice to give the whole thing a nice spicy
kick.
