Ethics are a luxury for people who can afford new pants.

<p>Reading some of my secondary and tertiary comics, plus one I was just forwarded to, semi-randomly in Ethics class.  Not really unethical to be randomly wandering the Internets just now, simply a bit rude.  My biggest problem was that I had a hard time keeping from laughing at the first occurence of <a href="http://ohmygods.timerift.net/strips/2002/03/14.php">the Futhark kids</a>, partly because it would distract the class, and partly because I wasn't sure I wanted to explain the geeky joke.</p>
