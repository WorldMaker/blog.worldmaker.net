<p class="last">Family!  Games!  Games with Family!</p>
</div>
<p>In my <a class="reference" href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/2008/jul/03/blogs-round-table-i-cannot-survive-without-little-/">July round table post</a> I stated that I've always contextualized
gaming as a social activity, even or perhaps <em>particularly</em> when it
comes to video games.  Much of that feeling comes immediately from the
fact that I have a large extended family.</p>
<p>One of the earliest memories that I have of a big family holiday,
probably Thanksgiving <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2" name="id2">[1]</a>, included a card table set up somewhat
centrally in the small den of my grandparents' home <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3" name="id3">[2]</a> with a jigsaw
puzzle.  It was in the way of mobility around the house and it subtly
encouraged everyone to glance at it from time to time, and to contribute
a piece whenever one might be found.  I don't remember much more than
that, or even if I ever saw that particular puzzle finished.  I just
remember a sense of the event being almost richer just by having that
shared puzzle.  (I was taught several times over that jigsaw puzzles are
always more interesting as a social activity.)</p>

<p>There are many memories of other holidays and other games.  Easter as a
holiday, when you are young, is almost solely about the hide-and-seek
competition for sweets.</p>
<p>But videogames have not been exempt: my first experience with a NES was
when one of my (many) cousins would bring his for the holidays.
Eventually I was the one bringing a NES around for the holidays.  My
grandfather <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id4" name="id4">[3]</a> had a PC before I had one personally, and games were
obviously a common activity upon it (and at times, them).  Games would
be requested as gifts and it was important to show off your haul of
games to family, often debating which one to start with and play
together.  Even Gameboys would be passed around or gathered around for
communal play.</p>
<p>Outside of the holidays, with my three siblings, games would always be
important in passing time or solving disputes or just having fun, and
more often than not games would be rejected or ignored if they couldn't
be shared.</p>
<p>It's just about time to pick the games that I want for gifts come the
holidays.  I'm already salivating with dreams of Thanksgiving feasts to
come, and maybe a good game or two with my family.</p>
