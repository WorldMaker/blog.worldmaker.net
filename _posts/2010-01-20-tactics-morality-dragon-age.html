title: On The Tactics of Morality in Dragon Age
---

<p>I'm coming into <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> after a replay of <em>Mass Effect</em>,
with <em>Mass Effect 2</em> clearly on the horizon, so expect more than a few
<em>Mass Effect</em> comparisons. Plus, <em>Mass Effect</em> thus far is the only
Bioware RPG I've managed to complete a playthrough (with a record of
two, now).</p>
<p>I appreciate <em>Dragon Age</em>'s use of relative morality over the dualism
models that have become fairly standard. The morality of a given choice
is primarily determined by the reactions of whichever companions you
brought with you to witness them. It fits a world that is full of many
shades of gray on the morality spectrum (including the central Gray
Wardens).</p>
<p>In practice, however, I find the control of this as a system somewhat
opaque and aggravating, particularly within the larger context of the
game as a whole. Firstly, there are the obvious complexities from moving
from a 2-Bar morality system (as in <em>Mass Effect</em>'s Paragon and Renegade
counters) to an N-Bar system. Where <em>Mass Effect</em> can (smartly) use the
vertical axis of its conversation wheel in rough correspondence with the
Paragon/Renegade decision, <em>Dragon Age</em> has no such shorthand.  (On the
other hand, it would be nice if <em>Dragon Age</em> had at least found some
replication for <em>Mass Effect</em>'s use of the horizontal axis. But that's a
whole other topic of discussion.)</p>
<p>What frustrates me most, however, is the dissonance between the work put
into combat tactics systems compared to the lack of equivalents in
morality and conversation tactics. Certainly this is nothing new in the
world of RPGs, but <em>Dragon Age</em> seems to especially make it more obvious
and harder to swallow (particularly as I start to read FAQs/wikis to see
the fragility of decisions easily accidentally made). Before even
getting into combat I can set roles and mechanistic tactic system for
each of my companions. I see their full load-out of equipment and
skills, and I could choose those skills whenever they level shaping them
in a direction of my choice and most of their equipment was probably a
choice of mine as well. I can switch between their perspectives and
directly make use of their skills. Subsequently all of that power
remains in my hands during combat.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the tools at my disposal for conversation and
morality: I can talk to them one on one prior to a major conversation
and maybe get some small feel for their moral system, but only in the
opaque and hazardous English of some writer. I can't easily throw
hypotheticals at them to see how they might react in the future. I don't
have numerical stats/weighting for any of their discussions besides
after the fact reactions that are murky. I can take over a character to
have them pick a lock or use a skill, but can't make them converse. I
particularly can't have a companion take over the lead role in a major
conversation. Not many conversations even give me an opportunity to
directly sidebar with my companions and get their direct opinion on the
matter at hand. A few attempt to make it up by having the companions
throw in unsolicited opinions, but thus far in my play the
correspondence between opinions during conversation and points awarded
after the fact are somewhat inadequate, and the characters may as well
offer riddles.</p>
<p>I know the full capabilities of my companions during a battle, including
how they would react in most situations, and yet the conversation
doesn't provide any a priori tools to determine how a character might
react to a conversation choice. Even if this knowledge was just
restricted to the companions at hand, it is curious in its lack
(particularly compared to how much Bioware's binary morality systems do
in that direction). I can choose combat auto-reactions (&quot;in the
situation of x, do y&quot;), why can't I choose auto-conversation reactions
(&quot;maximize character x's opinion of you&quot;)? (Entire conversations that
are mostly automatic (&quot;get all the information you can; use kind
persuasion when applicable; try to maximize character x's opinion of
me&quot;) actually sound like a pretty cool feature, but then I tend to enjoy
cutscenes.)</p>
<p>I know for some players that lack of early feedback is a welcome part of
the game. It just belies the nature of the rest of the game systems in
an interesting way. To the ways that I would like to play the game, I
would like more feedback, more tactical information, in assessing the
conversations and meaningful choices of the game.</p>
<p>I think I summarized this pretty well on twitter: as with many RPGs, the
things that Dragon Age provides for me to micromanage aren't really what
I want to micromanage. The things that I would be interested in
micromanaging, such as my character's relationships with other
characters and the world at large, the game fails to provide me the
tools to do so.</p>
