title: Surprising Beer from a Surprising Source...
---
<p>I must have missed this beer in season, or the places (supermarkets) that I frequent haven't gotten any in until late post-sales, but Anheuser-Busch's Winter Seasonal is surprisingly good.  It's an interesting bourbon-aged ale (which I like), with the twist of vanilla beans added to the cask.  So the oak/bourbon flavor is followed by a strong vanilla aftertaste and I'm fairly impressed.  I'm actually curious what they do with the beans after aging, because I'm thinking shavings of the ale/oak/bourbon-infused vanilla might be excellent on a good cake...</p>
