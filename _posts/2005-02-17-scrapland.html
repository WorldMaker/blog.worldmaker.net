title: Scrapland

<p>I was reminded today about how much <a href="http://www.americanmcgee.com/wordpress/">American McGee</a> rocks out.  I learned of <a href="http://www.scrapland.com/">American McGee presents Scrapland</a> today, which apparently was released for the PC in November.  I walked to the nearby video game store after Ethics, picked up a copy, and I've liked it.  It's so rare to find a good original PC release anymore, and seeing that this one did in fact hit the PC before the consoles was a nice surprise.</p>

<p>Some of the reviews were making it sound like <i>American McGee presents Grand Theft Flying Vehicles</i>, but it's actually closer to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/freelancer/">Freelancer</a> or <a href="http://beyondgoodevil.com/">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.  Freelancer being poorly reviewed (I admit it could have been much more than it was, but it was adequate) and BG&amp;E being well reviewed, but little played (it's cheap to find a copy and I would recommend buying it if you haven't played it).</p>
