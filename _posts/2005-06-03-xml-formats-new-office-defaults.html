title: XML formats new Office defaults
---
<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=73329">New XML formats will be the Office 12 default formats</a>.  This is really excellent news.  The files are very simple to play with XSD-backed, ZIP-compressed things.  As a coder who spent 3 months in stupid corporation land, this is pure excitement.  So often the pointy-hairs want reports in .DOC, .XLS, .PPT from a web application, and this will make things much simpler to do.</p>
