title: The Beldor Space Transit Authority

<h2><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Post</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> Year 579; Beldor Space Year 1</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Captain Jon Velas was the obvious choice for the Chair
Person of the Beldor Space Transit Authority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He approved of the plans and offered to market them, but did not wish to
take the position.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He suggested
Vice-Captain Erin Raynard, his wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i>BSTA Falcon</i> was the first train put into
service.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was ten years of hard labor
to see it off the ground, and much of the planet was there at its launch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Based on ATSÃ¢â¬â¢s <i>Hawk</i> class, the train
was a sight that put tears in many eyes on that day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most memorable experience for most of those gathered
there that day, wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t the witnessing of the reopening of the main rail (the
secondary had remained active throughout the interim), or that slow
acceleration of the <i>Falcon</i> itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Governor-Elect, Mr. Jamis Tylor, gave his heartfelt and ad-libbed
speech, which we now know as his <i>Incredible Visions</i> speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>For all of us this is a momentous occasion, but little do
we realize the significance of itÃ¢â¬Â¦<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
this moment of great despair we seek hope.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ã¢â¬ÅBeldor IV Command, this is the <i>BSTA Falcon</i>
requesting dock.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The newly appointed head of Beldor IVÃ¢â¬â¢s Orbital Docking
Facility, Humber Crantz smiled to the cameramen as his stomach
pretzelized.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ã¢â¬Å<i>BSTA Falcon</i>, this
is the Orbital Docking Facility, all rail status indicators are green, docking
clearance granted.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i>Falcon</i>Ã¢â¬â¢s approach was a textbook deceleration,
but Humber Crantz couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t watch it. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>His
eyes were glued to the numbers on his display.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The media-people behind Crantz clapped as the <i>Falcon</i> docked.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To Crantz, the rail intensity numbers
steadily decreased as the new stealth software on his board sent hundreds of
signals down the main rail, shutting it down until it was to be used
again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although the system could be shut
down immediately via an emergency protocol from ASTÃ¢â¬â¢s software, such a
derailing would have a dangerous effect on the train, which was still Ã¢â¬ÅinsideÃ¢â¬Â
the rails.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The media saw the cerulean path fade until only a single
weak blue strand was left connecting the two sister planets.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A media person immediately asked the obvious
question on why the secondary rail was left standing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on">Humber</st1:place>, whose knots had
left him moments ago, smiled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The new
BSTA Software was his baby, which is why he had been given head of the Beldor
IV ODF.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅThe reason is fairly simple,
first, compared to the main rail, the secondary rail is nearly invisible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Second, we have gotten used to being able to
send messages and communicate across the planets via RailNet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Data travel is bound by the speed of light
the same way that the trains are, and so we have to make use of the rails to
send it at decent speeds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unlike a
train, however, data takes up very little room, and so even with a single rail
we still have much more bandwidth than we currently use.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

the <i>ATS Connecticut</i>, he held his title with relish.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Museum, like some of the great archeology
and xeno-archeology Museums the Republic had once had, was a combination
research facility, showroom floor, and link to the past.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As head curator, Jer was given free reign to
wander from lab to lab, offering suggestions and just appreciating the speed of
development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Museum was one of the first buildings set up by the then
blue sky BSTA.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its first artifacts are
still its most prized, the Charter Plaque and Name Plate of the <i>ATS

exhibit (which still brought tears to his eyes after ten years), he noticed a
couple of kids, no more than fifteen, arguing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ã¢â¬ÅMy mom says it was dismantled because it contained alien
slime that might kill us all!Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ã¢â¬ÅYeah, well my dad says thatÃ¢â¬â¢s not true.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ã¢â¬ÅWell then why?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jer coughed and the boys turned around to face him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They recognized his face almost
immediately.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅHello boys.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mind if I tell you why?Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They both were really excited by this idea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅSure, Jet Man, tell us!Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He motioned to the bench against the far wall and they all
sat down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ã¢â¬ÅSo, you all know the story about how the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><i>Connecticut</i></st1:place></st1:State> was the Last Train to
Beldor V.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on"><i>Connecticut</i></st1:place></st1:State> was a huge train.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was one of the biggest trains in use.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was useless just floating in space, and
its systems were just going to fall apart over time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There arenÃ¢â¬â¢t enough people or money in the
whole system to keep a train that big going or even necessary, so it was
decided to dismantle her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a
second important reason.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fleet of
Intra-Solar trains, the ones like our <i>BSTA Falcon</i>, was taken by AST
before the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><i>Connecticut</i></st1:place></st1:State>
docked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We used the systems we salvaged
to help us build the <i>Falcon</i>.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ã¢â¬ÅYou didnÃ¢â¬â¢t know how they worked?Ã¢â¬Â asked one of the pair.</p>

BSTA, I oversee both companies for the moment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Beyond that, we, BSTA CMC, donate to the Foundation a yearly grant,
donate their land property here in the BSTA Complex, and pay their staff.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They do all of the R&amp;D, and when they
discover something interesting, they hand it to us on a silver platter.<span

anyone else who asks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we feel it is a
necessary competitive advantage and the Foundation decides it is not of
importance to the field as a whole, we can purchase an Exclusivity contract to
be renewed annually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also train our
staff, as well as anyone else who wants trained train engineers.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The new BSTA Train Yard was an impressive sight.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even from Beldor VÃ¢â¬â¢s surface, the Train Yard
could be seen to take up half of the Second MoonÃ¢â¬â¢s face.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Having been built during the disassembly of
the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><i>Connecticut</i></st1:place></st1:State>,
it was technically a few months older than the Museum, but the Museum got top
billing because the Train Yard was not functional until a year later.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Train Yard was larger than any single
Yard that ATS had owned because ATS had had to compete with the colonies on the
various moons during SolÃ¢â¬â¢s largest population era.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The Train Yard could handle up to twelve ATS<i>
Statesman</i> class trains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Chief Foreman of the Yard, Mr. Robert Ã¢â¬ÅBeltÃ¢â¬Â Sander, was
a tough and capable man hired out of BeldorÃ¢â¬â¢s small but lucrative Ã¢â¬ÅantiquesÃ¢â¬Â industry<a

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had already taken to the job like a fish
to water and the Ã¢â¬ÅsloydoidsÃ¢â¬Â loved him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He was currently overseeing the production of three more <i>Falcon</i>
class ships for Charter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A couple of the
sloydoids smiled as he walked near the production area.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They paused their welding to give him a short
sharp salute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sloyder Menarques and
Fireman Stelfry, his supervisors, were already in the production area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>StelfryÃ¢â¬â¢s semi-permanent scowl became worse when he noticed
Sander approach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅWe are behind schedule
by four days.Ã¢â¬Â<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t a question, and
it wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t a mere statement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In seven
words Stelfry had delivered an accusation, a court trial, and a corporal
punishment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Menarques merely looked
blank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
Ã¢â¬ÂWell,Ã¢â¬Â Sander began, Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢ve been telling the boys that they wonÃ¢â¬â¢t get their
slop buckets if they donÃ¢â¬â¢t pick up the pace.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the sloydoids laughed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another sounded like he had fatal case of
cough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Menarques cracked a slight
smile.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stelfry merely scowled on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅEnough with the jokes Sander.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We promised the Board that we would have full
service to the entire system by the end of the year.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ã¢â¬ÅCome on, Fireman, lighten up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I donÃ¢â¬â¢t tell you how to scowl and you donÃ¢â¬â¢t
tell me how to run my boys.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve still
got 12 more milestones to pick up the slack, and weÃ¢â¬â¢ve been having a tough job
of engine installation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another couple
of hours and weÃ¢â¬â¢ll be two days <i>ahead</i> of schedule.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I promise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Go back to bed or whatever pleasure reading you brought.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sander truly hated Stelfry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Stelfry had spent one afternoon on a field trip to the Titan Train Yard
at the old Academy and thought he knew how things worked on the Floor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sure they had the ATS milestone documents to
work from, but knowing the milestones, and knowing how to pass the milestones
were completely different concepts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Ironically, the production of the <i>BSTA Falcon</i> had gone without a
hitch in its five-year design and production.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, they could certainly expect hiccups as they ramped up from
five-years and one under production to five-months and three under
production.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>ATS, after all, had 500
years to get things streamlined!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Menarques was what frightened Sander, though.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stelfry was the Ã¢â¬ÅOld HandÃ¢â¬Â, a stereotype
repeated many times throughout history.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Menarques was as young as most of SanderÃ¢â¬â¢s sloydoids.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was also as new to this as Sander was,
having gone through the same BSTA Ã¢â¬ÅBoot CampÃ¢â¬Â, as it had been called, a
three-week-long class that tried to cram down 3-years of Academy study.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sander wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t even trusted with the title of
Sloyder due to his past, and Foremen were rarely Academy-trained anyway, but
Menarques already had that air of self-importance around him that the Ã¢â¬ÅOld
HandsÃ¢â¬Â had without the experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After that conversation, a distressed Sander walked to his
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He fell onto his bed and ruminated
until a railgram came through.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He read
through the document, titled Ã¢â¬ÅCharter PlansÃ¢â¬Â and gave a loud belly laugh.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fireman Stelfry was to be given active duty
on one of the as yet unnamed ships on the Floor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even better, the Board had been watching
things here and had decided that Sander was a better man for the position of
Train Yard Fireman than Sloyder Menarques.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Although the position changes werenÃ¢â¬â¢t to take place until after the
Charter, he was allowed to tell his men immediately.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He jumped up and ran all the way to
production floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When his sloydoids saw him huffing and puffing towards them
they immediately stopped what they were doing, afraid of bad news.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He caught his breath and began, Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m sorry
boys, but after the Charter I wonÃ¢â¬â¢t be your Foreman anymore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They gave me the Ã¢â¬ËiÃ¢â¬â¢.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the gang pondered this, one of the slower ones yelled,
Ã¢â¬ÅBut Chief, they canÃ¢â¬â¢t sack you, youÃ¢â¬â¢re the best they have.Ã¢â¬Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When one of the others guys clapped Sander on the back, the
speaker said, Ã¢â¬ÅWhat?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>WhyÃ¢â¬â¢s it such a
good thing?Ã¢â¬Â<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ã¢â¬ÅSander is going to be Yard
Fireman!Ã¢â¬Â</p>
