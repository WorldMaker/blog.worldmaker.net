title: As if I weren't already depressed enough...
---
I was doing so well staying away from posting about religion, but I've decided that one needs look no further than the Westboro Baptist Church's latest public excrement to prove that the xian God **cannot** exist.  In a season supposedly espousing the xian virtues of Charity and Compassion these so-called "Christians" at the WBC have taken a song, *We Are The World*, entirely about Charity and Compassion, and twisted it into the bigoted and hateful *God Hates the World*.  I cannot in good conscience directly link to such intolerant bullshit.  Search for it yourself if you are prepared for possible irreversible psyche damage.  Ugh....  I think I'm going to be sick.
