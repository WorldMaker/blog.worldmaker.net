<p><b>We got the cable internet set up at our apartment.</b>  I've been able to download the 2200 or so email backlog and the CoH/CoV I7 content is preloading...</p>

<p>Today was spent hanging out with my roommate, Matt, and his parents.  The last roommate, Jose, showed up late tonight.  Yesterday I finally bought my bike, there was a nice bbq amongst some interns, and Matt and I visited the Pro Sports Club (Mercedes Benz of Gyms), which we'll probably be visiting again soon.</p>
