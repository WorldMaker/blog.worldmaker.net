Awesome.  Proof that more writers should collaborate.  Set in a parallel version of Heinlein's `Future History`_ (`Detailed timeline of the Future History`_) with some of Heinlein's "juvenile" elements and recent events (9/11, war in the middle east) folded in.  (Then further skewed by a major event in the book.)  It's a fun, classic space opera (with some "romance") that begs the question of why Robinson has not written one before...  Having read quite a bit of both writers, I think it does read more like Spider, but I like the feel of Robinson's writing (bad puns and all) around Heinlein's world building.
