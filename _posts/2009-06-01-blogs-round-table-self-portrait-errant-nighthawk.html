<blockquote>

<p>The joint is one of those few places open this late on a weekday
evening. You hover over a plate of greasy food, biding your time for
the anonymous meats to give up the ghost and finally die. A cup of
coffee is at hand, from which you gently sip, the warm comfort of the
dark beverage sluicing caffeine through your tumbling mind. You know
the coffee only exacerbates your late night existence, and yet to not
finish this cup would seem like a shameful waste of a good friend.</p>
<p>A couple at the bar nearby is telling a deep dark tale of tragedy,
anger, and even a tinge of lust. Beyond the general emotion of their
tale, you can't fathom a bit. Their domestic dispute is entirely a
foreign language to you. Even when they speak in English they speak in
riddles and your mind fails to latch on to any sort of contextualized
meaning at all.</p>
<p>The joint's night manager isn't interested in your thoughts other than
barest obsequiousness necessary for what he hopes will elicit a good
tip. His hand is quick to the carafe whenever your coffee seems low.
His weary half-smile manages to seem slyly conspiratorial whenever he
does so.</p>
<p>Maybe you'll head for what purports to be home in this city after you
finish this next cup of coffee...</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">May's Topic</p>
<p class="last">The topic for May asks us to explore the themes of a piece of
non-interactive art as fodder for a game.</p>
</div>
<p>Gianfranco Berardi of <a class="reference external" href="http://gbgames.com">GBGames</a> in his May Round Table post explores
thoughts on <a class="reference external" href="http://gbgames.com/blog/2009/05/if-art-was-a-game/">a game based upon Michaelangelo's The Last Judgment</a>. He
ends with a challenge to discuss Edward Hopper's painting <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks">Nighthawks</a>.
I've decided to tackle that challenge.</p>

<p><em>Nighthawks</em> is one of those paintings that has managed to seep its way
into the urban subconscious, particularly in American culture. It is one
of those paintings that seemingly everyone knows and no one knows its
name. <em>Nighthawks</em> was partially inspired by film noir and has a filmic
quality to it, and in turn <em>Nighthawks</em> has inspired much following pop
culture, particularly in being a key work that Ridley Scott used to
explain his vision for <em>Blade Runner</em>.</p>
<p>The painting highlights a late night diner, brightly lit with
fluorescent bulbs and casting deep shadows upon neighboring empty
streets. The patrons in the diner seem mostly lost in their own internal
worlds than at all interested in the other people mere feet from them.
The painting is often described as a painting of the desolation and
loneliness, even amongst other people, of the urban landscape.</p>
<p>As an urban resident, with many tales of my own that involve a stop at a
late night diner, I see some simple comforts there as well. It is hard
to make out much of the normal trappings of a diner, but there does seem
to be a fairly prominent coffee/cappuccino machine in the background. I
think there is comfort in coming in off the empty streets into a small
dive of a diner and drowning your insomnia in cheap coffee and greasy
food.</p>
<p>Given the crime film influence in the painting, it is possible to tease
possible back stories from the painting. Perhaps there is secretly a
clandestine meeting of symbols taking place late at night. Perhaps there
is a small guilt of an earlier crime contributing to one or more of the
character's insomnia. Perhaps it isn't guilt but anxiety.</p>

<p>Certainly the painting offers a lot of food for thought of emotions and
states that have yet to be well captured in an urban sandbox game such
as the <em>GTA</em> series. I think it is another example that speaks to my
assertion that gaming could stand to gain from reusable urban settings.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I think that to truly deal with some of the
emotions of the painting that it is time to talk about breaking some of
gaming's &quot;rules&quot;, or perhaps more precisely <em>taboos</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="this-game-isn-t-about-you">
<h1>This Game Isn't About You</h1>
<p>Gaming has become extremely proficient at giving the protagonist, the
player character, center stage and center of attention. NPCs all react
to just about every thing the PC does. The PC always has particular
goals available (and perhaps obnoxiously reminded from time to time of
them). The PC knows everything about the landscape and eventually
commands all of the potential of the world around him.</p>
<p>To some extent, this is what we want as both players and designers.

<em>GTA</em> is eventually about running amok as a super-criminal and <em>Saints
Row</em> would be less fun if it wasn't about mindlessly blowing things up
in the name of game violence.</p>
<p>However, just as much of this feeling that world nauseatingly revolves
around every action of the player character, comes from a lot of taboos
that have accumulated over the years. These taboos come from an
assortment of &quot;market wisdom&quot;, designer idealism, and feature
oneupmanship. Most of them have their place in gaming, and serve useful
purposes <em>most of the time</em>, <strong>but</strong> to some extent some of these have
taken a sort of religious fervor behind them, and it is easy to forget
that all rules have exceptions.</p>
<p>I think the easiest historical example of the accumulation and
inherent eccentricity of some of these taboos comes from the example of
the maze: Mazes were components of adventure games from the start. The
original <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em> included the very template from which
many original games gleaned how to do a maze. The <em>Zork Trilogy</em> can be
seen as nearly one large maze partitioned into three games. For a time
it was considered almost an unspoken requirement that all adventure
games include a maze. Time passed and designers got tired of making
interesting mazes and having a maze at all in an adventure game became
synonymous as design elements in lazy or bad games. Eventually it became
entirely anathema for a game to include one at all.</p>

<p>Some say that mazes simply ran their course and that there are no new
ideas for mazes. Others say that players don't like mazes. But yet,
simple 2D mazes continue to show up in activity packs and pen and paper
sets. I find it curious that the taboo seems to have affected even the
&quot;casual games&quot; industry. Where are all the maze casual games? There
certainly seems to be an interesting disconnect in that mazes are the
one pen and paper &quot;traditional&quot; game that does not seem to be widely
represented amongst casual games...</p>
<p>The point here is not that I think that a game that should inspire the
emotions of <em>Nighthawks</em> needs a maze, more that the taboos I'm about to
mention seem to have, in their own ways, similar historic contexts. It
is a useful allegory, I think. You can think of a desolate, lonely
existence in a large city in terms of mazes of city streets and
emotional complexes; neither of which care about you specifically.</p>
<p>To particular point: a challenging maze requires a certain amount of
&quot;found readability&quot;. Most game taboos and rules that have accumulated
over the years are about forcing inherent readability as close to the
surface and to the player as possible. Rather than asking a player to
learn to navigate the structure of a maze, to find readability in the
subtle differences between nodes, to make for themselves the map
necessary to navigation, gaming has become somewhat single-minded about
making sure that every player has access to the maps they need up front.</p>

<p>There are quite a few tools of readability that have, for some good
reasons, become popular and nearly &quot;mandatory&quot;: clear objectives
screens, GPS, markers and goal-orienting paths. Certainly these devices
limit player frustration, but they are all player-centric tools that
shelter players from desolation and loneliness. It is a fascinating
trade off between frustrating players and allowing players to explore
truly alien environs.</p>
<p>Current wisdom is that players should never feel frustrations, that
games should be as easy to grok as possible. In many ways it is a good
trend. But frustration is an important emotion, and should not be
overlooked as a powerful tool for storytelling. Certainly there are
other things that can be done to compensate some: certainly we can do
better with in-game street signs?</p>
<p>Imagine an urban sandbox without a map or a compass. Imagine quite a few
NPCs and few that seem to even acknowledge your existence. Imagine not
knowing your goals explicitly and trying to navigate a web of alliances
and counter-alliances that seems to have existed before you started
playing and doesn't exist for you to personally control by the end of
the game.</p>
<p>Sure, a lot of player's are going to immediately come away with &quot;less
fun&quot;. You aren't going to hit an lowest common denominator demographic,
and you probably can't do it as a huge budget affair <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[1]</a>, but certainly
the audience for such a game is something larger than zero. Particularly
if you can assuage your audience that the drama you are trying to create
is worth the frustration they might feel trying to navigate it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-difference-of-night-and-day">
<h1>A Difference of Night and Day</h1>

<p>We use the phrase &quot;a difference of night and day&quot; meaning a large
difference, and yet the differences in video game terms are mostly
cosmetic. Of course, balancing real-time-like time flow is a complicated
matter: Players balk when businesses in game seem to follow actual
schedules. Yet on the other hand no one seems to have figured out how to
best represent those hours we humans actually spend asleep, or those
hours we must spend between gaming sessions. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id3">[2]</a></p>
<p>Player characters seem to already exist as insomniac hawks, looking for
something to entertain time at all hours of the virtual day. I think
that to do the painting's emotion is simply a matter of trying to better
contrast day and night. Give the players an option to sleep and let them
be eaten by the anxieties of missing crucial clues if they don't spend
some of the less active night whiling away a few hours as an insomniac
in an all night diner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-d-build-it-if-i-could">
<h1>I'd Build it if I Could</h1>
<p>To be honest, I don't think that a game that yields some of these
emotions is that far from being made. Given access to <em>GTA</em> or <em>Saints
Row</em> it is possible to chuck out much of the gameplay, reaction AI and
UI and write an urban drama about an insomniac alone in a crowd of
people, whose major time to think about the world about him is the hours
he might spend in a dive diner.</p>

<p>The stories are there for the writing, but the stages do not yet exist.
Worse, perhaps, is that for now the producers don't exist either that
are interested in paying for dramas that alienate potential audience
members or that challenge the audience in ways that are taboo. Is it not
perhaps a terribly irony of an industry about creating challenges that
there is such a thing today of &quot;too challenging&quot;?</p>
