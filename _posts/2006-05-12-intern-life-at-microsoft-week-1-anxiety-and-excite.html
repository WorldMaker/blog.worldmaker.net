title: 'Intern Life at Microsoft: Week 1 Anxiety and Excitement'
---
<p>We're still waiting on the DSL setup materials for our apartment, so I'm quite behind on my less important and/or interesting personal email (no offense meant by that, though).</p>

<p>So, Microsoft, huh?  Things have already been wild/fun, and I just started on Tuesday.  I'm still having a hard time shaking the big company anxiety/cynicism that my previous employers scarred me with, but fortunately I think most of that is washing off.  Not to mention the trepidation that comes from feeling so fortunate and so afraid to screw up lest the fortune vanish.</p>

<p>I'm amazed at the level of trust here.  I have administrator priviledges on this box here at work and have been able to set things up the (weird) way that I like them.  I can't explain the morale boost of just having such niceties as Vim 7, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=22E69AE4-7E40-4807-8A86-B3D36FAB68D3&displaylang=en">Consolas font</a> (quickly becoming my font of choice in every plain text situation), <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org">Foobar 2000</a>, or a local copy of my entire music collection copied from my MP3 player.  I was even given the chance to grab a copy of the latest Office 12 (2007) Beta.  (Office 2007 rocks, by the way.  I love the keyboard-friendliness of the very pretty and functional Ribbons, among other things.)</p>

<p>Today included a morale event (Picnic), and I was entrusted with (given) armaments (nerf weaponry)...</p>

<p>I'm really excited to see what next week might be like...  The weekend alone may be reasonably busy.</p>
