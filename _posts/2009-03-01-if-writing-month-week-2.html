<p>This week I had a heck of a cold and on the flipside of that cold I got some good work done on my game for my startup. So a few hours today for <a class="reference external" href="http://if.unlore.com/amongst2/">&quot;Amongst the Stars&quot; Release 2</a> I &quot;merely&quot; fleshed out the interior of the ship (the <em>USS Rosser</em> being the name chosen late last week).  The game has expanded almost double to 2253 words, 8 rooms, and 13 other things. As far as Week 2's provided goals exploration is still the form of the &quot;puzzles&quot; and they aren't much by any definition.  On the other hand I've prepared for Week 3's provided goals, which was the general direction I was already heading, by populating the ship with a few NPCs.</p>
