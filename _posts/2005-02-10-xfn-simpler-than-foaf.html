title: 'XFN: Simpler than FOAF'
---
<p>It's a big buzzphrase right now: "The Semantic Web".  In fact, it isn't a new idea (it was actually hoped for in the early days of the web), so much as one finally understood and being realized.  So, I've been doing my part to increase the size of semantic data on the web.  If you remember I recently started using better [blockquotes], putting proper information in the CITE and TITLE attributes, then using a small javascript to output nice source lines.</p>

<p>Tonight I wasted some of my sleep time playing with "people relationship markers".  This is one of the bigger areas I've found of the burgeoning Semantic Web world.  The major work in this area is the RDF-based <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/"><acronym title="Friend of a Friend">FOAF</acronym></a>.  The problem with FOAF is it can be a bit of work to write one and keep it accurate and/or useful (which reminds me that I've still yet to write one).  On the other hand, <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/intro"><abbr title="XML Friends Network">XFN</abbr></a> use the meta-data REL attribute of the HTML Anchor tag (links) to mark relationships between people based on the websites they have/run, and geared towards blogging and blogrolling.  I put together a quick JS function (based on the [blockquote] JS) to list the REL attributes of a link.  I'll officially release it "open source" later.  Before I do that, I'd like come up with (so you can behold more of my crappy gimp skills) or find some sort of icons for the XFN relationships, which I think would make the script all the more useful...</p>
