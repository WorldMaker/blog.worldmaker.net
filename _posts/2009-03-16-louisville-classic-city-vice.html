title: Louisville as a Classic City of Vice

<p>On the heels of my own post referring to Derby, I was referred to an <a class="reference external" href="http://theurbanophile.blogspot.com/2009/03/louisville-vice-city.html">article at The Urbanophile about Louisville marketing itself as a Vice City</a> (via <a class="reference external" href="http://brokensidewalk.com/2009/03/16/louisvilles-potential-as-vice-city/">Broken Sidewalk</a>) and in commenting chanced upon <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzPLxq2VXzU">this spirited ad for Louisville</a>. I certainly think &quot;Just Add Bourbon&quot; is a more interesting slogan than &quot;Possibility City&quot;. Oddly enough, the ad appears to be from GLI's <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a> Community Branding Project, or at least it's on one of their YouTube accounts.  Needless to say, I think there is some benefit in chasing after a more Vice-filled &quot;New Orleans of the North&quot; campaign.</p>
