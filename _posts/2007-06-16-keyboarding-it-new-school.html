title: Keyboarding it new school...
---
<p>I've taken the plunge and on Thursday switched cold turkey to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.colemak.com/">Colemak</a>, a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a>-influenced layout that puts some emphasis on being easier to switch to and saving a few of the ingrained <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY">Qwerty</a> shortcuts and punctuation.  I'm rather happy with the choice and am slowly regaining speed.  I expect to best my previous speeds easily.</p>
<p>As someone that does a lot of typing I've long considered using a smarter layout.  I've been aware of Dvorak since middle school, but never felt like tackling its significant learning curve.  I'm hoping the switch will be something of a proactive strike against carpal tunnel/RSI, which I worry about sometimes.  I'm also using this as a opportunity to finally rid myself of my touch-typing &quot;left-handed limp&quot;.  (My left hand in Qwerty was skewed a key to the left and my right hand &quot;wandered&quot; to make up for it.)</p>
<p>I swear I might have paid more attention to touch-typing in school if the first lessons had used words (Tennessee can be spelled in the two inner fingers of Colemak) instead of gibberish (fkjjkddkk, anyone?).</p>
