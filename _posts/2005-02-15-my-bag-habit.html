title: My Bag Habit

<p>I was just reminded about how much I've spent on stuff-carrying bags&trade;.  Just to provide more stuff for people to read from me that no one actually cares about, I thought I might share what I'm using.  I blame it on <a href="http://www.sfbags.com/index.htm">Waterfield Designs</a> that I've become somewhat obsessed with quality.  For my laptop I bought a <a href="http://www.sfbags.com/products/sleevecases/sleevecases.htm">SleeveCase</a> from them that has been genuinely awesome.  I can quickly attach the shoulder strap and carry just the laptop (the piggyback gives me room to throw, say, power cables, mouse, and wireless card), or, I can put the SleeveCase into my backpack.  Waterfield doesn't sell back packs (they have some really nice courier bags, but I prefer a backpack), and so when my 5 year old Eastpak died I ended up buying a nice <a href="http://www.llbean.com/">L. L. Bean</a> <a href="http://www.llbean.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?categoryId=38084&storeId=1&catalogId=1&langId=-1&parentCategory=5181&cat4=2952&shop_method=pp&feat=ln">backpack</a>.  It took some searching...  The Eastpak had spoiled me, but I wanted something bigger.  A straw poll amongst my friends pointed toward L. L. Bean, and I became infatuated.  I particularly like the fact that there are enough of them around that people won't suspect it of carrying anything more the textbooks (for those times I want to carry my laptop), but distinct enough that I can spot it from a distance.  (The cheap monogramming helps, too.)</p>
