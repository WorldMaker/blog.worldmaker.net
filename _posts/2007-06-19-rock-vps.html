title: Rock On, VPS
---
<p>My current VPS host (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tektonic.net/">Tektonic</a>) just announced that they will be doing as several have started doing and will start allowing unlimited transfers between VPS accounts, which is great and my future plans may just use it...</p>
<p>(This sort of thing is great for several forms of load balancing, particularly because a server doing one and only one thing is always more efficient than a server doing more than one, but then your servers need to communicate...)</p>
