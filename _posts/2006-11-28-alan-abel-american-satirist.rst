title: 'Alan Abel: An American Satirist'
---
I recently encountered `Alan Abel <http://www.alanabel.com>`_ in a recent Wikipedia pedestrianation (`Alan Abel's Wikipedia entry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Abel>`_).  I've took about taking absurd hoaxes to their extreme conclusions, and so it's an almost immediate admiration.  He took several politcally-motivated hoaxes (satiring some of the lowest elements of the political system) across several years of active work.  Most defining is his 3 year "SINA" (Society for Indecency to Animals) campaign that had Buck Henry pretending to be the President of an organization attempting to clothe large 4-legged animals.  People even tried to contribute to the fake organization.

I'm very interested to see the documentary on him, `Abel Raises Cain <http://www.abelraisescain.com/>`_.

On a side note, I'm tempted by the `Get Smart Box DVD Set <https://www.timelife.com/checkout/micro.jsp?pageId=1183&page=getsmart>`_.  (Something of the Wikipedia path I meandered the other day: Casino Royale -> Baccarrat (simple Blackjack-like casino game that offers the closest casino bet to 50:50, and the game in the book) -> James Bond -> Get Smart -> Buck Henry -> Alan Abel; somewhere in there was DuMont as well (The Lost American Television Network).)
