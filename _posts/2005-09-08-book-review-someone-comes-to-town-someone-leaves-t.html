title: 'Book Review: Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town'
---
<p><i>Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town</i> (being the latest novel by <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>) was slow to grab my attention and then didn't hold on to it as well as I would have liked.  I really liked <i>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</i>, but the direction he's moved toward since just hasn't intrigued me as much.  <i>Down and Out</i> was about normal people being normal people in a weirder world (one in which average people could take control of and shape Disney World rides).  <i>Eastern Standard Tribe</i> (and now <i>Someone</i>) reversed that and was about weirder people trying to be normal people in the normal world.  <i>EST</i> offered something akin to a spy novel thriller, and that made it entertaining when it wasn't spending so much work trying to give a glimpse into the "normal world".  In <i>Someone</i> I found the normal world sequences even more tedious.  The weirder sequences offered some small bits of fun and interesting visual images, but in their way seemed much more like a drawn out punch line than an actual attempt at something interesting.</p>

<p>I figure I should clarify, though, that the "normal" sequences of <i>EST</i> and <i>Someone</i> are actually more "pop geek" (like the stuff they put on TechTV (before G4) that people drooled over and became "popular"; we could install <i>lee-nix</i> and set up wireless networking and be cool!), thus I guess I might identify with them as being closer to "normal" a bit more than the next guy.</p>

<p>I particularly felt that the denoument for <i>Someone</i> left several things to be desired.  Much of the book seems to hint that it might be leading somewhere; that there might actually be some sort of idea of where things are going;  that there might be some big revelation towards the back of the book.  I was disappointed.  The book just sort of ends, with no real questions answered or anything really major accomplished.  Overall the book was "cute" and "interesting", but not very deep.</p>
