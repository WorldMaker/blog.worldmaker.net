<p>Just a quick cool hack I found:  I added to my template <a href="http://demo.1976design.com/blockquotes/">Dunstan Orchard's Blockquote JS file</a>...  For those that don't know, this uses the existing, although rarely used, CITE and TITLE attributes/tags to create an attribution link for a blockquote.  Apparently, even though the standard has had the CITE attribute for several years now, no browser has yet to actually display it in a meaningful way.  This JS file appends an attribute line to the blockquote to help solve this problem.  It works in Firefox, but not IE.</p>
