title: My Position on Political Contributions

I apologize for this brief interruption of a self-imposed promise to not post
politics on this blog, but I posted this general policy statement on someone else's
walled garden, and it seemed useful to have a copy posted here that I may point to
in the future. The statement is as follows (feel free to ignore it if you do not
follow this blog for politics):

At some point in college I made a pledge that I would never again donate to a
political campaign until there are major and massive reforms to campaign finance
laws. (Including and especially a revocation of the Citizens United decision and
the elimination of Super PACs.)

The DNC has built this finely honed instrument of mass spam trying to convince
you that they run on “bake sale money” and that you can and should “vote with your
wallet”.

What they fail to tell you—what they are *afraid* to admit—is that when
you vote with your wallet you agree that rich people “deserve” more votes than
you. It’s a terrible system and feeding it money only makes it worse.

What they also fail to tell you is how much of the “bake sale” is a lie. They
don’t actually give a hoot about your $20 “donation”. That barely covers (and
often doesn’t) the postage and labor in sending you all those letters, emails,
texts, and phone calls. The illusion that you are contributing to the bake sale
keeps you *complicit*. The DNC is just as much financed and run by Super PACs as
the RNC. Even if we don’t have as many examples of outright grift and stealing
on the DNC side such as the “We Build the Wall PAC” that helped a millionaire
finance his next yacht, you are still wholly complicit in the darker grift that
when a Super PAC is named something like “Citizens for Liberty” they imply that they
mean ordinary citizens like you that donated $20 and maybe got a tote bag to
remember it by. Super PACs can **never** mean any such thing. The citizens that
Super PACs actually care about are rich jerks, whether or not the PAC is
financing their next yacht or the PAC *is* their next yacht because they thought
sailing the political waters would be a fun hobby or sport.

Having not donated in a couple of decades has greatly dropped the amount of spam
I get from this horrible system. It hasn’t solved it, though. I do appreciate
that the system accidentally merged the records of my father and I which makes
it a lot easier for the spam to go directly to my spam folder when it doesn’t
have my name on it. I’d recommend more people try that, but I cannot tell you
how it happened.
