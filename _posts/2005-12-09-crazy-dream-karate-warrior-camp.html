title: 'Crazy Dream: Karate Warrior Camp'
---
Last night I dreamt that I was high schooler and in my final day of this "Karate Camp", trainging to be a "Karate Warrior".  The camp was led by a crazy "Master Sensei".  Master Sensei had a huge bankroll and bought a private pacific island solely for this camp.  My roommate (didn't seem to be anyone I actually knew) and I had awoken late and had to catch up with the group in the huge obstacle course that winds its way through the Jurassic Park-like amusement park building; each building a seperate excersize in the course.  ("Master Sensei would not be pleased at us," was the major thought running through our heads.)  The two of us skipped the buildings, and instead looked for the group.  We finally caught up with the group jogging towards the final major portion of the obstacle course.  We ended up at the back of the group running down this group of stairs that spiraled down the side of the island mountain the camp was situated upon.  (I don't know why, but running up/down stairs seems to be a common image in my dreams.)  These stairs had a wide curve that wasn't too bad, but were rather narrow, the glass panels and metal handrails quite near to our sides (think escalator, I guess).  At first we were using the handrails as leverage to gain a bit of speed on the way down, but then a warning announcement sounded the handrails slowly raised above our heads.  We continued just about as fast, almost solely due to the momentum, and there was that feeling that if I tripped I would knock down every single person in front of me.  At the bottom of the stairs was a water tank and scuba lines.  Each of us grabbed a scuba line and dived into the tank.  An automated system then tangled up the lines and we had to (claustrophobically) untangle ourselves and exit the tank.

The next thing I know its the end of the day (about 6PM, no idea why that time in particular seemed to be there in my head) and we had been given the choice to leave on that night's boat or to stay one more night and watch a major fight.  My roommate and I were definitely not going to miss the boat and so I packed and soon enough ended up at the crappy Tiki Bar that served as the nearest human outpost's airport, with about half of the others (3 or 4 of us).

Then things stopped being from my perspective and switched to a crappy movie perspective, without any real entanglement in the feelings of the people.  It is also when the dream went entirely wonky.

The fight that night was between two of Master Sensei's "Champion Warriors" and it ended with a Mortal Kombat-like fatality; with the defeated warrior left as not much more than a skeleton.

It turns out that Master Sensei was collecting the sweat and bones of the Warriors and bottling it as a perfume called "Spirit of the Warrior".  There was a conveyor belt that soaked the warrior skeletons in the cooking perfume.  Mostly this just passed more of the skeleton essence into the perfume, shrinking and destroying the skeletons.  In the case of that night's fight's new skeleton the skeleton in the cooking perfume became a zombie and took back on the shape of that Champion Warrior.  It groaned and walked off the conveyor belt.  Master Sensei just happened to be walking by the belt system and reflexively fatality chopped the zombie and threw the skeleton back onto the conveyor belt.

Master Sensei then had a lengthy argument with his wife and then killed her with a poisoned perfume he had her mix for herself.

The other four kids sensed something was up when they saw the dead wife's body and escaped to the woods.  One of the four was a girl and she was much better at hiding for some reason (guys were too stupid to think about it, I guess), and watched as two maintainence men discovered the boys, killed them (again, direct fatality into skeleton) and dragged them to the perfume lab.  There the Master Sensei, a clone of his wife, and some evil-looking guy, were playing with the bones of the three dead guys and working on building a clone of them.  They succeeded and let the clones (which in this case were young toddlers now) play freely outside the building.  The girl spotted them, freaked, and ran for the Zeppelin Mooring Tower (a tall straight staircase; once again someone running up stairs) hitting the signal at the top.  Master Sensei realized she was still on the island and sent the maintenance guys after her, but they were too late as just luckily there happened to be a blimp in the area to respond to the signal and pick up the poor frightened girl and drop her off at the crappy Tiki Bar Airport.

Message of the dream:  Don't go to crazy private islands built by crazy asian guys?  Zeppelin Mooring Towers are a girl's best friend?  I really have no idea what this "Mortal Kombat" meets "Jurassic Park" meets "Summer Camp" dream means; it was one of the weirdest I've had in quite a while.  It was probably just anxiety for my last final (that I just completed a few hours ago), and the dream is perhaps a fairly good metaphor for how brutal and weird this final was...
