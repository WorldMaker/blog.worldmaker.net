title: Inventing the Post-Enlightenment Polytheistic Religion
---
<p>I'll take a break on the story discussion for a brief interlude on the system that I've been playing with for a lark these past few weeks.  I've been taking Intro to World Religions and reinvolved in extra-curricular religion-based sci-fi works.  I've been thinking about what values a post-enlightenment polytheistic religion might take on, and how it might relate to its dieties.  Think about it, I'm taking nominations for "god promotions" (great thinkers, mostly), and I'll write an indepth look into the weird exercise I've put into this thought experiment.  (Keep in mind that Enlightenment values are in some way anti-religious, rightly often ignoring and always sceptical of the supernatural, so I've been thinking about revolving things around Pragmatism and the ripple effect...)</p>

<p>Not much of a point, but fun and possibly useful for some fictional work...</p>
