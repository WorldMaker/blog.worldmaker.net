title: Social Online Games in Learning
---
<p>A researcher, Yolanda Rankin from Northwestern University, is doing studies on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2006/main.php?f=conference&amp;p=edu&amp;s=40">Evaluating Interactive Gaming as a Language Learning Tool</a> by using MMORPGs, EverQuest 2 being the particular choice, to build competence amongst English as a second language students.</p>
<p>It's yet another study that shows that MMORPGs as social vehicles help promote social/lingual competence.  I remember about ten years ago having the debate with someone that social games, regardless of the fact that face/manner/voice might be hidden, do indeed build useful social skills.  It's something of a common sense thing for gamers, and I think that I benefitted quite a bit from the many hours I spent playing old MUSHes/MUCKs, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gamegardens.com/gardens/view_game.wm?gameid=25">Acrophobia</a> (still in the Top 9, woo!), and even posting crazy ideas and pompous attitudes to now <a class="reference external" href="/2006/aug/17/ye-olde-scramm-bar/">long departed forums</a>.   It's just great seeing more and more intelligent academic studies doing scientific verification of these good things, particularly to counterbalance some of the FUD studies like the ridiculous <a class="reference external" href="http://nintendo.about.com/od/screenshots/ig/The-62--Violent-Pac-Man/The-62--Violent-Pac-Man.--2e.htm">Pac-Man is 62% violent</a> study.</p>
