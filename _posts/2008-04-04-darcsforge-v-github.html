<p>Interesting...  <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> has a few of the features that I've always intended for Darcsforge (some of which already exist as skeleton code in the repository)...  Possibly more reason to go ahead and push Darcsforge further down the stretch...</p>
