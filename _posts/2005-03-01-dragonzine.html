<img src="/images/dragon.jpg" alt="DRAGON" align="right" /><p>For nearly a year I released 2-3 short stories to the Internet on the 25th of each month.  There were a few stories I was able to post from friends/people I met, but the bulk of the content was my own.  At its peak I wrote somewhere between 5k-6k words in a month.</p>

<p>Read the collection in <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/worldmaker.25663425">book form</a>, for the diehard collector in random internet-posted writings.</p>
