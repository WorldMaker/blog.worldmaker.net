<p>...er...  Anyway, playing around with a weird mess of psuedo-IPA.  Just goes to show that maybe I should spend more time studying the IPA.  It would be cool to get together some group to push for a better standard English spelling.  I'm the return of the thorn (&THORN;, &thorn;) to the language's spelling would be cool, and the schwa (&#601;) is so often used in American speech patterns that maybe we should adopt it as well.</p>
