title: Requiem for a Hard Drive, plus a dash of morning road rage
---
1. The horn was not installed to be your impatience meter.
2. For an average inner-city stop light, say the intersection of 3rd and Hill, it does not make a hill of beans difference in when you get to your destination if it takes you 30 seconds longer to get to a damn *red* light.

Impatient bastard.  *Oh, am I holding you up from your important job and life or death meeting?*  Don't want to be late for sitting at that red light in front of you another minute and a half...

Anyway, my desktop hard drive crashed, again, (that damned click of death) and I'm saddened.  Important day to day stuff is on my laptop hard drive at this point, but there were plenty of non-essentials like a veritable ton of piecemeal documents of works in progress, interesting titles, random sequences of events.  Sure I might not have finished a lot of that anyway, but much of it means a great deal to me...  I'm just not sure if I could afford the $300+ to recover that data.  I think it is worth it to me, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to my pocket book, you know.

This time freaked me out, too, because most of the previous times it has happened (and I've seen the click of death way too many times in this life) I've had a little bit of warning and a bit of a chance to pull off a lot of those same files.  (Some of them have seen more than one click of death attempt at their digital life and it seems even sadder to give up on them this far down the line...)  This time I didn't notice any of the customary warning signs and there I was half-way through a YouTube video when the hard drive began the click of death, the computer rebooted and informed me that no drives exist.

I guess it just go to show that even after all this while I still don't back up "the little things" regularly enough.  I might go through my piles and see what sort of incomplete back ups I might have of some of these things...

Also, it actually happened a couple of months ago, but I've just now given up on denial and reached that depression plateau...
