<p>I just finished Stardust the other night, in my slow attempt to round off what's left of Neil Gaiman's that I haven't read.  As usual there was nothing but chocalatey fantasy goodness wrapped in a jaunty bow.  I'm looking forward to movie.  Speaking of which, Neil Gaiman in a recent blog post on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2006/11/stardust-news.html">progress of the Stardust Movie</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
So the Stardust Movie News is that the head honchos at Paramount saw a rough cut two weeks ago, and decided that it was strong enough to be a &quot;summer tentpole&quot; movie. So it's been moved from March 2007 to July 2007.</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations and my condolences to Neil and the movie crew.  I know that I for one will be in theaters for the film, and hopefully the movie will survive the rough and tumble Summer film season.</p>
