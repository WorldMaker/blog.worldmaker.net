title: A New Generation, A New Workplace
---
<p>I know that I've felt awkward in "traditional workplaces", and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2005-11-06-gen-y_x.htm">a USA Today story</a> (via <a href="http://www.acm.org/careernews/issues/v1_i19.html#story_2">ACM Career News</a>) has some good points on what so many of my Generation (the boringly named "Y", simply because it follows "X" alphabetically) are expecting of the workplace.  First of all, I felt particularly striking was the "About Gen Y Workers" sidebar:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2005-11-06-gen-y_x.htm" title="USA Today"><b>:High expectations of self:</b> They aim to work faster and better than other workers.<br />
<b>:High expectations of employers:</b> They want fair and direct managers who are highly engaged in their professional development.<br />
<b>:Ongoing learning:</b> They seek out creative challenges and view colleagues as vast resources from whom to gain knowledge.<br />
<b>:Immediate responsibility:</b> They want to make an important impact on Day 1.<br />
<b>:Goal-oriented:</b> They want small goals with tight deadlines so they can build up ownership of tasks.</blockquote>

<p>For the rest, I'm just going to quote the ACM synopsis, which I think pulls out most of the article's major points:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.acm.org/careernews/issues/v1_i19.html#story_2" title="ACM Career News">
<p>The 70 million or so members of Generation Y are expected to change careers faster than any previous generation, leading to difficulties for employers attempting to retain and recruit talented high-performers. In addition, "Generation Y is much less likely to respond to the traditional command-and-control type of management still popular in much of today's workforce." Most likely, this means that companies will need to foster a work environment that respects the "speak-your-mind philosophy" and independent thinking habits of Generation Y. Failure to do so could mean a loss of these employees to other companies which are more flexible to the needs of Generation Y.</p>

<p>The article also catalogues the characteristics of Gen Y: an understanding of benefits like 401(K) retirement plans; a focus on attaining a work-life balance; an embrace of constant change (new jobs, new careers); and a fervent belief in a casual dress, laidback work environment. Most of all, Gen Y has shown a "total comfort with technology."</p>
