title: On the Warner, New Line Blu-Ray Exclusivity Decision
---
<p><a class="reference external" href="/2007/oct/22/technology-tidbits-useless-skills-and-gaggle-footn/">I bought an HD-DVD player a few months ago</a> and I check the HD disc selections at stores like Target or <em>Insert Other Giant Store Here</em> and I watch for any deals on movies in that format.  I've been asked now a few times what I think about the announced switch of Time Warner-owned labels WB and New Line switching to Blu-Ray exclusivity in a few months...</p>
<p>It's a small disappointment, primarily because I was hoping to get <em>The Dark Knight</em> on HD-DVD when it is released, to coordinate with my HD <em>Batman Begins</em>, but I can get over that.  I, usually, buy movies slowly, anyway, because I'm saturated with rentals, TV showings, and trips out to a public popcorn stadium as it is.  (Even if I have a really nice private popcorn stadium of my own at this point, if I do say so myself.)</p>
<p>It doesn't really anger me, though.  Even <strong>if</strong> it is all over now (and it might not be): I got the HD-DVD drive (as an attachment to my 360 that I can also attach via USB to a Windows PC) for a reasonable price with a ton of free movies to watch, and a good majority of my purchases of discs since have been in Combo format (a nicety in the HD world unseen on Blu-Ray) so in the worst case that I have no accessibility to an HD-DVD player I can still watch those films on a normal DVD player (and I don't see those going out of style any time soon).  I haven't &quot;lost&quot; anything in this decision by Warner.  I'll even keep buying Warner HD-DVD discs while they last, and am hoping to see some good sales along the way thanks to this.  I might even buy a second HD-DVD player, &quot;just in case&quot; if they fall at or below $99 again.  (I have no plans to a Blu-Ray player at this time...  I don't have any good reason to.)</p>
<p>I'm still going to even recommend HD-DVD to people with HD screens and a desire to put interesting things on them.  HD-DVD remains the most generally <strong>consumer-friendly</strong> choice and the newly announced lack of content producers is a shame more than anything.</p>
<p>Ultimately the disc format doesn't even matter all that much for me.  My medium term plans are to build a universal media server for myself, at which point DVDs and HD-DVDs are just more bits in the bucket to stream through the æther.  In terms of bits the difference between HD-DVD and Blu-Ray is amazingly thin, even, and I wouldn't be surprised if, in even the near future, I could burn decent transfers, by myself, of my HD discs onto BR.  If someone writes a decent Java engine to emulate Microsoft's HDi those transfers might even have full menus and everything...  Simple, but powerful tech implemented in complex tech, for the win.</p>
<p>I have no problems with media as bits in the æther, as I've explained before in my willingness to buy music through DRM-free MP3 etailers over CDs, and I've got my eye on VOD services, anyway, for future media purchases.  Just reason to more invest in hard drive space for my future media server...</p>
