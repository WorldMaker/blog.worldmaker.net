title: "Difficulty Curves: The Comparative Costs of Combat"
---

Decided to top-post my own comment from [Rant of the Moment: Difficulty
Curves](http://blog.worldmaker.net/2015/06/02/rant-difficulty-curves/)
since it ended up not surprisingly being long and grandiloquent on the
subject. For context, [Stephan
Messier](https://disqus.com/by/stephanmessier/) wrote, with respect to
why game developers might not want a "Skip Combat" button:

> The developer is essentially devaluing the content they spent
> thousands of dollars to produce, only to accommodate (potential)
> player preference.

My reply was of course a gentle "read the original article" prod, with
bonus hyperbole:

Unsurprisingly this drew an incensed response from a new pseudonymous
follower named "Birdu Gilbert" [spelling included]:

It was in fact intentional hyperbole, but I'm afraid it's far from
"utterly moronic". As you seem to be unaware: I do have an idea from
whence I speak: I am a software engineer and I have studied video game
budgets (on purpose; as a matter of trying to build a business/business
plan). I agree with you that combat system development is not easy, as
you have largely argued (and for which I'm grateful as a software
engineer in that solving difficult problems present me with a generous
salary), but it is cheap from a budgetary/accounting standpoint. The
combat system in a game is a fixed cost. A good combat system can be
used as easily in a single game as it can in multiple games. Franchises
share as much of a combat system as they can to better minimize fixed
and sunk costs over the lifetime of a game engine. Sure, such things are
typically iteratively upgraded over time, but they don't ever escape the
accounting category that is fixed costs. The software engineers and
systems designers building your combat system, if managed sustainably,
are themselves fixed costs to your studio... Change over the course of
development is in fact cheap, because if you are doing it right, you
aren't changing the number of developers over the course of the project,
only refocusing and reprioritizing them over time. Those are fixed
costs, and yes it's not entirely accurate economically to categorize all
fixed costs as cheap, it's a perfectly valid approximation of the truth
for use in hyperbole.

But even budgeting for a single game for a studio that doesn't expect to
be in business after that game ships: a well built/balanced combat
system typically works equally well in running three combat experiences
as it does three million. Thus just in terms of investment dollars to
gameplay hours output (assuming as most of the current videogame
criticism industry seems to that gameplay hours are in fact the metric
to optimize), that combat engine is a fixed cost. Need more hours of
gameplay? Have your players grind through very similar combat
experiences for hours for some incremental currency or particularly
unlikely random drop... Sure there may be incremental variable costs
such as art work, level design, etc to keep this grind interesting to
players (although Bejeweled, Tetris, and even Destiny are great examples
that no, not really, if your core "combat" loop is shiny enough), but
I'd argue all such variable costs inevitably, if managed correctly,
should be categorized and budgeted as "Story" costs more so than
"combat". However, even if you disagree with me on where the blurry line
balance is on those variable costs, that still doesn't invalidate the
core assertion here that the combat system of a game is dominated by
fixed costs versus gameplay hours.

Good, well done story content, on the other hand is hugely dominated by
variable costs that can quickly inflate a game's budget for every hour
of story-filled gameplay hours: writers, artists, musicians, voice
actors, level designers, etc. None of that is cheap and all of that is
going to be the primary concern for the game's accountants and budget.
Most of it is stuff that is of quickly decreasing value to the player as
it repeats or is reused (whether within a single game or across a
franchise). We've yet to unlock the secret to procedural storytelling
(if we ever will, barring something unforeseen such as true high
functioning artificial intelligence). We've yet to find a story loop
anywhere near as satisfying to a large number of players as a basic
Match-3 or Rock Paper Scissors can be, even with the most minimal of
"icing on the cake".

Finally, I appreciate that you feel that combat is the priority of game
design: for some kinds of gamers that's a valid opinion. But there's
more kinds of gamers than just you. Combat systems are not even "core"
to game design, they are a useful tool in a belt that should be full of
tools. That belt should hopefully be full of a lot of tools, because
games should be the most inclusive of media. That fact that you speak of
Visual Novels as if distinct from games speaks volumes of how our
opinions are unlikely to agree. Visual Novels are games. Visual Novels
are often great games. I've played "Visual Novels" that were better
RPGs, both in terms of the implicit CRPG connotation of your post (your
cute belief that DMT is the end-all/be-all of RPGs as a genre), but also
in the original denotation of "role playing" and better inhabiting a
role that isn't your own. I would not be surprised were you to play said
games and to have a different opinion, but clearly we are different
types of gamer with different goals in our gameplay.

Thanks for playing, my new pseudonymous friend.
