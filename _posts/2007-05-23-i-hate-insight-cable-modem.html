title: I hate this Insight Cable Modem
---
<p>5 months with this cable modem and 2 service interruptions/degradations.  Yuck.  The last time it was revealed that the source of the problem was: 1) not enough power at the pole, and 2) squirrels.  I'm assuming it is a combination of the exact same two problems again this time and I really don't feel up to making the necessary calls again...  Sigh.  Not too many other options either.</p>
