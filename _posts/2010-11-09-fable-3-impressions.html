title: Fable 3 Impressions
---
<p>Last night I pushed through to the credits for my first playthrough of
Fable 3. I haven't done any of the side quest cleanup, and I'm not sure
I'm going to. I also haven't gotten very far in a second, evil
playthrough, but I probably will push that one further. I liked the
game, but I feel that invites a lot of its own criticism.</p>
<p>Fable 3 seems to me like an okay sequel that might have possibly made a
great expansion or DLC bundle. Much of Fable 3 feels no more than an
abridged version of Fable 2 with a new epilogue and a slightly new skin.
Unfortunately for Fable 3, every time that it invokes memories from
Fable 2 it generally compares poorly.</p>
<p>What things are particularly new for Fable 3 seem odd, and have
questionable merit in the grand scheme of the game. Having played many
hours of the game, I'm still not sure what they really add to the series
or to what Fable 2 accomplished.</p>
<p>Most obvious is the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; menu system. I know that it has gotten
flack for various reasons. It feels to me like a system that was planned
for Fable 2 but didn't make the cut. It certainly reminds me of what
Fable 1 tried with its Guild Hall. From a technical perspective the
Sanctuary was much better than Fable 1's Guild Hall: the Sanctuary is
apparently always loaded in memory and load times are nearly absent.</p>
<p>I kind of liked the Sanctuary as an experiment and a place to visit or
hang out. I don't feel like the game made a strong case for why it was
necessary or worth the obviously large amount of time and effort that
went into building it. It is a very cool tech demo, and decent, if not
great effort, at internalizing the menus within the game fiction, but
was it required?</p>
<p>Much less successful for me was the &quot;Road to Rule&quot;. For whatever reason
I felt the &quot;metaphor as place&quot; to be really silly and nearly fiction
breaking. As a possible extension of one of the series' more insane
characters it almost can be forgiven, if it didn't feel so disconnected
from most of the rest of the game. Particularly given that the &quot;book&quot;
metaphor in Fable 2 worked mostly just fine (and remains for dog
training), I see the Road to Rule as an extravagant use of resources.</p>
<p>I liked the always accessible place to view snapshots in a character's
history provided by its plinths. However, I think there is probably some
better compromise between the Road to Rule and Fable 2's usage of
snapshots in statues and in the finale.</p>
<p>Switching gears, as a sometimes steampunk enthusiast I wanted to love
the aesthetic changes in Fable 3, but they seemed lackluster at best and
invisible/non-existent at worse. I realize that only 50 years is
supposed to have elapsed between Fables 2 and 3, but there still seems
to have been better room for exploring the aesthetic change. Emblematic
to me is the underground monorail with only one station. It makes for a
gorgeous set piece, but it is missing at least one station, if not more.</p>
<p>Finally, but most verbosely, I generally make it known that I'm somewhat
antagonistic towards Fantasy as a genre. I'm very picky about the series
that I follow that are or contain Fantasy, particularly without a
healthy dose of &quot;Science&quot;. In particular, I think Fantasy going back in
particular to Tolkien shows a lot of ugly seams of luddite thinking and
couched racism in its literature. I praised Fable 2 for avoiding many of
those traps, but Fable 3 had a couple of moments that worried me. I was
not worried greatly enough to give up on the series altogether, yet, but
enough that I will have more involved debating before any future
purchases.</p>
<div class="admonition-spoiler-alert admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Spoiler Alert</p>
<p class="last">Spoilers below as I discuss some of the story of the game.</p>
</div>
<p>What I saw was a sort of unintentional racism. I'm hoping that it was
unintentional, of course, and I'm not really in a position to judge, but
I do think it should be brought up. Frankly, I felt that much of Aurora,
a persian/middle-eastern pastiche on the Fable 3 map, seemed somewhat
<em>wrong</em> to me. I'm not sure if any of the stereotypes it played upon
were necessarily offensive (and I am sure that they have been used in
games many times over before, even if they are offensive).</p>
<p>It isn't the place that most worried me, however. I was more worried by
the lazy treatment of the Shadows in this game. After some good usage
and examination of the Shadows in Fable 2, some of the lazy plotting for
them in Fable 3 felt like they were bordering on some worrying questions
of religion and race:</p>
<p>Because the Shadows are (spoiler) the big bad of this game, they are
reserved mostly until the latter half of the game. Because of this,
their big presence moment is that ever-present point in the story cycle
where the player visits some far-off fantastical new place, and in this
case it is on the way to Aurora that the player has a major Shadow
encounter in this game. This is troublesome to me for several reasons,
which I will return to.</p>
<p>There might have been an attempt here at showing sort of an
&quot;enlightenment&quot; concept that the world was shrinking, the people of the
world were shining lights into the world and pushing the Shadows further
out into the edges. (Which would reasonably explain why they are so
desperate and so forceful as an inciting event in this game.) However, I
think that message isn't as well delivered as it might be.</p>
<p>What troubles me about this, is that the site of evil from which the
Shadows operate in Fable 3 seems larger and more powerful than the
others I've seen in previous games. While this makes sense from a story
respect that you want the big bad to be the most powerful thing that you
will see, it seems poorly placed.</p>
<p>Beyond the simple fact that the upgraded Shadow effects now feel ripped
straight out of 2008's <em>Prince of Persia</em>, there's the worrying
implication that the Shadows might be closer to their seat of power,
their &quot;home&quot;. I'm, again, hoping that this is not what was meant by
Lionhead and an unfortunate oversight, but I'm having a hard time not
referencing the many years of history and context of the real England
and the real fertile crescent when examining these parts of Fable 3's
storyline.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the implication was an accident or not, it seems
to me a very bad idea to have the source of much of the game's
worst, most concentrated evil be based out of Aurora's Arabian analog to
attack Albion's British analog in a psuedo-historic, albeit fantastical
situation. I think there is too much historical, political, religious,
and racist baggage attached to these things; it is a can of worms that
seems better left unopened.</p>
<p>Having opened it--- intentionally or not--- the game doesn't seem to
have anything real to say about it, other than using it for somewhat
obvious, telegraphed and clich√©d hero's journey goobledygook. It is just
one more failure of the game to communicate any deeper message than
silly vanilla morality. But it is just that sort of silly black and
white morality of the series that mostly works in the previous games and
that seems to so worringly place this one somewhere disturbingly in a
real life shades of grey moral quandary.</p>
<p>It is easier to assume naivety or laziness on the part of Lionhead here,
than any sort of racism or religious motivation. But the game brought up
these worries to me and I am a History-averse white male American. This
made the game a little bit less fun for me, and I consider myself on the
sidelines for most of the issues this brings up... Again considering
that is within earshot of the Tolkien-heritage Fantasy that much more
routinely evokes this sort of outrage in me, I may be over-reacting
somewhat, or at least keep a watchful eye for just this sort of thing
and finding it because I am looking for it. Has anyone else been
pondering about this?</p>
