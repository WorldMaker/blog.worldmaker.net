title: 'Louisville Directions: Hubward/Rimward and Sunward/Widdershins'
---

<p>There probably won't be a huge following for this, and it'll probably signal me out as being truly nerdy, but I find east/west and north/south distinctions in Louisville confusing and sometimes completely useless.  Therefore, I've decided that I'm going to start using the terms hubward (inward/downtown), rimward (outward/uptown), sunward (clockwise/generally marked as west-bound on Louisville streets), and widdershins (anti-clockwise/counter-clockwise/generally marked as east-bound on Louisville streets) when describing directions in this city.  For instance: The University is just a few miles rimward on 65.  My parents' house is few miles further rimward and several miles widdershins of the University.  Shelbyville Road generally runs Hubward/Rimward whereas Hurstbourne Parkway generally runs Sunward/Widdershins.  The interstates are hubward/rimward and the bypasses are sunward/widdershins.    To get to my parents' house from the University I generally travel via either 65 rimward to 264 widdershins to 64 widdershins to Hurstbourne widdershins or 65 hubward to 64 rimward to Hustbourne widdershins if I'm in the mood to bypass the Watterson or to peruse more of 64's prettier scenery...</p>
<p>Feel free to join my quest to use radial directions in Louisville, because I think they make a good amount more sense in a city that has a radial layout and roads rarely are directly north/south/east/west.</p>
