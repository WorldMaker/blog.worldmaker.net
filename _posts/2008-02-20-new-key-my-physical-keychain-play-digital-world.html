title: A new key on my physical keychain to play with in the digital world...
---
<p>I bought an Athena USB cryptographic token through <a class="reference external" href="http://www.trustbearer.com/">Trustbearer Labs</a>.  First out of the gate is that I re-delegated my OpenID to <a class="reference external" href="http://openid.trustbearer.com/">Trustbearer's OpenID Provider</a> and now am officially too secure for most normal OpenID usages (blog comments).  Oh well, I'm hoping to play with the token and see what other cool things I can do...  Right now I'm mostly curious if I can use it for OpenSSH keys...</p>
<p>On the OpenID front, I've been contemplating for a while that I want to switch from the current version of <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.comments</tt> to <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-threadedcomments/">django-threadedcomments</a>.  If I were to do the switch it would be a good opportunity to add in some niceties for people that want to login/validate with an OpenID...  not that I get a lot of comments clamoring for such things, but mostly because I think it would be nice to have.</p>
