title: 'Heroes Speculation: Why did Chandra Suresh first visit Gabriel/Sylar?'
---
There will be some Season 2 spoilers in here, so avert your eyes if you
gave up early in the season.  Personally I think that *Powerless* was
the great mid-season finale I was looking for and I didn't mind the slow
exposition/build-up to it.  (I forgot to watch it on Monday due to some
brain misfiring and part 2 of *Tin Man*, so I watched a DivX copy on my
Xbox 360.  So thanks to the Dashboard Fall Update I was able to watch
Heroes in HD on my nice 32" screen, which I can't normally do (due to
lack of tuner/HD service).)

So to fill some of the void until Heroes Volume 3 (*Villains*) I've been
watching Volume 1 in HD-DVD with my brother.  What's interesting about
that is that I roped my brother into watching Heroes about four or five
episodes in and he never really saw the early episodes in Volume 1.  One
of the questions that came up was "Why did Chandra Suresh start with
Gabriel (soon to be Sylar)?"

In thinking about it from after Volume 2 I think a pretty simple picture is
developed.  Chandra ("Papa") Suresh was seeking his "Patient Zero", the
first known appearance of the hero genetic markers.  In Volume 2 we have
a much better idea of who the *real* Patient Zero currently alive is:
Adam Monroe.  It makes a lot of sense that Adam Monroe himself, and also
The Company that Adam Monroe helped found, would be interested in
obfuscating any and all information about Adam Monroe.  Interestingly
enough, Chandra's research (via the Human Genome Project, which is
presumably controlled by The Company) wasn't entirely off the mark: Adam
Monroe was indeed in New York, just locked up in The Company's New York
facility.  So the question is, why would The Company, and I think it was
obviously the lugubrious company at that point, send Chandra to Gabriel
of all of the people with the genetic markers in New York City?

I think it was deemed at the time that Gabriel was "harmless".  He had
not at the time manifested any known powers and so it made sense to send
Chandra Suresh to him.  I think that the Company may have hoped that
powerless, at the time, Gabriel may frustrate Chandra's research and
potentially send him packing back to India.  That almost happened.  They
may have even sent Chandra in (observed by Eve) to see if Chandra might
even manage to help Gabriel discover/unlock his powers, after The
Company itself had already failed to do so.  What The Company failed to
foresee was the way that Chandra's "disappointed father" attitude and
evolutionary beliefs would interact with Gabriel to unlock the twisted
dormant psychotic Sylar.

Unfortunately, Chandra Suresh underestimated how long the genetic markers have been in the gene pool and failed to question why his Patient Zero had never actually manifested any powers, much less seemed to have any real contact with Humanity...
