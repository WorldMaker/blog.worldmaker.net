<p class="first admonition-title">July's Topic</p>
<p class="last">This month's topic: Difficulty!  How do you handle it when the going
gets tough?</p>
</div>
<p>As far back as I can remember games for me have <strong>always</strong> been a
communal, social experience.  I can tell you that my earliest memories
involving video games have to do with my older cousin bringing his NES
with him during the holidays, or the days of tall-tale telling around a
library copy of <em>Cosmic Osmo</em>, or the trading of tips and floppy-based
save games for <em>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</em>, but nowhere,
I think, is my dependence on social interaction for game playing as
apparent as it is when it comes to difficult challenges in games.</p>

<p>I've admitted before that I generally know my own horizon of gaming
skills seems pretty near compared to many people that I know and meet.
In some ways this has contributed to my generally broad knowledge of
gaming as a whole, as my easy frustrations early in so many games have
left me all the more eager to move on to many, many more games.</p>
<p>For most genres, if I have <em>beaten</em> a game, it was in tandem with
friends.  Even games that I haven't beaten I never would have seen as
much as I did if it were not for my family and my friends.  My brother
and one of my sisters and I spent a few weeks in a "Star competition" in
the same save game of <em>Super Mario 64</em>.  Soon after that we spent a
summer attempting to beat <em>Rayman 2</em> by sharing a single controller and
deciding whose skills best matched which zones.  One of my skills at
that time turned out to be a decent mastery of the game's underwater
mechanics.  My sister and brother were better matches for various types
of races.  We'd trade off general platforming and slides.</p>
<p>In this Age of Achievements its sometimes hard to share games like that.
Adding to the fighting about who gets "the next easy part" there it is
the added problem of whose profile gets to show off the achievements.
It's easy to see how this has almost directly led to a wondrous
renaissance in Co-op gaming.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a>  My brother and I have beat <em>Halo 3</em>

and <em>Gears of War</em> on every difficulty level at least once.  I can't say
that I would have even beat the games on the easiest difficulty level
solo.  I certainly haven't beat <em>Kameo</em> yet.</p>
<p>"I" finally beat the dreaded Meat Circus from <em>Psychonauts</em>, by handing
the controller to a cousin for the final acrobatics...</p>
<p>To me, Co-op is an obvious and necessary component for gaming, always
has been and probably forever will be.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a>  I've never had a problem
with looking something up in a walkthrough, it's just like asking some
strange acquaintance for a tip.  I know there is still a small vein of
developers and players that still sit in the "walkthroughs are cheats"
camp, even this many years post-internet.  I've always thought that a
designer should always feel that they aren't quite doing there job when
someone needs to resort to a walkthrough.  I realize that there is a
fine line between "hand holding" and "challenging" and no developer can
meet every lowest denominator, but Infocom used to bundle their
"Invisi-Clues" with their games.  Sometimes I think that developers
would still benefit by better in-housing their strategy information
dissemination rather than leaving it to outside publishers and random
netizens.</p>

<p>Sometimes I miss the era when cheat codes were common and wonder if
there may be some better compromise between cheat codes and
achievements...  There should be a "this is too hard and I'm frustrated
and after 50 attempts I think you should just give it to me" rule, I
think.  At the very least, if there is a story involved how about some
simple "let me skip this boss or section and come back it to it"...  I
might not get the "Boss Beated!" achievement, but I also don't lose
track of the story or lose my interest in the dramatic tension and maybe
when I do want that achievement or do want to 100% the game I'll go back
and actually defeat that boss.  I know there are some complaints about
"adaptive difficulty", but I've always thought that was a great idea.
I wouldn't mind a game getting a bit easier if I hit a rough patch.</p>
<p>At this point I'm sort of against "difficulty ramps" just because
experience has taught me that it usually means there will be some point
where frustration overcomes forward progress and I quit.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[3]</a>  I
think that there are much more interesting things to do in terms of
letting "hardcore" players experiment with complicated dynamics
interactions rather than simply monotonically increasing the difficulty
of the game's mechanics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe we don't need adaptive difficulty or better
difficulty slopes or better information dispersal, because that might
mean I play games a little bit less often with friends.  At least today,
when the going gets tough I start finding friends to give me a hand.  I
think that some of the best games are those that are shared with others,
and sometimes, "Hey could you help me beat the next boss?" is the best
pretense to grab a friend and share a game.</p>
