<p>I have one more day of work left here at Microsoft and then I'm one weekend away from flying home.  It's been a great experience, but I'm looking forward to the nice break I have before the next hectic school semester.</p>
<p>I packed up my Xbox 360 late last night as I watched the last half of South Park, and I shipped it this morning.  It should arrive soon after I do.  Only a few hours after I packed it my roommate showed up with a copy of <em>Gears of War</em> (Collector's Edition), which he had been given for free (he's an intern with Bungie).  Unfortunately, he'll have to wait until his own Xbox gets shipped here and I'll have to wait for my own copy.</p>
<p>There's a big football game tonight (Louisville vs. Rutgers) I'm looking forward to.</p>
