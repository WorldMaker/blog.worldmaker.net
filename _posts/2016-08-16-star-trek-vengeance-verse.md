title: "On the Star Trek Vengeance Verse: The Kelvin Timeline's Tenuous Ties to Star Trek"
---

Nero, upset at the loss of his home, demanding vengeance upon the Federation whom he
felt stood idly by, and was equally responsible for that loss. Opening a singularity
using stolen technology that had once been the Federation's last, failed, scientific
attempt to save Romulus, Nero thought he could destroy the Federation. [^1] Instead
his quixotic tilting at vast interstellar windmills fractured into a disparate
timeline. One where Nero was at least able to put a mark of vengeance into the
galaxy by imploding the important Federation founding world, Vulcan, and nearly
doing to the same to the Federation's other most well regarded founding world, Earth.

Three movies in and it seems clear the through arc of the Kelvin Timeline, so named
because the first history changing moment of vengeance wreaked by Nero was the
destruction of the *U.S.S. Kelvin* [^2], is an arc of vengeances against the
Federation.

The timeline was built out of the vengeance issues of one megalomaniac and seems
doomed for however long it will last to see ever further megomaniacal attempts at
vengeance and destruction. It is the Star Trek Vengeance Verse. That is its
defining characteristic and its sole reason for being, and that is weird and
not very Star Trek, but also entirely too much like Star Trek.

[^1]:
    *Star Trek Online* and other canon sources tell us he failed in the Prime
    timeline and is barely remembered as a hothead diplomat with a chip on his
    shoulder.

    Also, STO explores who the real architects of the Hobus explosion were.

[^2]: Reference the opening sequence to *Star Trek (2009)*.

I don't have much in the way of spoilers for *Star Trek Beyond* 
(aka *Trek & Furious*). I enjoyed it, and it was the most Star Trek imbued
film in the Kelvin Timeline, and thus the best Star Trek film in the Kelvin
timeline. Its problems are the Kelvin Timeline's problems, the baggage of
nothing but vengeance plots and attempts to take down and destroy the Federation;
a Federation one would imagine badly hurting with each additional vengeance
attempt. It is a wonder that this Federation is still capable of marvels amongst
the mayhem, and I would like to credit *Beyond* for having some of the best
marvels we have seen in any Star Trek timeline and also one of the better ensemble
films since the TNG era of films. It will come across as faint praise indeed,
but to me *Beyond* was at its best when it felt like the B-Side to 
*Star Trek: Insurrection*. The hard parts being that so much of the ensemble
work still has to rely on Kelvin Timeline baggage and increasingly decoherent
bleed-over from *The Original Series*. *Beyond* seems to do its best with that
to work with, but more so than ever begs the question on whether or not the
Vengeance Verse should exist and if it is actually good for Star Trek....

# The Vengeance Curse

I'm enough of a self-aware fan to realize that the Vengeance Verse's originating
vengeance arc, in our time, is most accurately *Star Trek: Generations*. Largely
**every** film of the *The Next Generation* crew involves a vengeance arc. Even my
beloved *Star Trek: First Contact* can be elevator pitched as one or another
vengeance arc.

It seems to be the nature of selling *Star Trek* movies to executives, and it has
only been exacerbated as the television shows have fallen out of favor. [^3]

Discounting vengeful probes of questionable sentience [^4], the original crew dealt
with a lot less vengeance. Mostly just *Wrath of Khan* and certainly that impacted
the Kelvin timeline pretty hard due to several non-fans hard-on for that particular
film. [^5]

[^3]:
    It doesn't seem worth hoping that *Star Trek: Discovery* will help given the
    now permanent corporate split between Star Trek's film and television divisions.

[^4]:
    That's right, I'm calling out the intelligence of V'ger and Mr. Whale Lover.
    What are they going to do about that sick burn? (They aren't going to deal with
    it rationally, they'll just try to boil more oceans or destroy more starships.)

[^5]:
    I hate STID so much it that I'm willing to throw out *Wrath of Khan* with that
    bathwater. 

# It's All The Temporal Cold War's Fault, Isn't It?

What if all the vengeancing isn't an accident in the Kelvin timeline?

It wouldn't be my blog without offering my own deeply overthinking it idea about the
Kelvin timeline's relationship to the Prime timeline: I think it is the "Vietnam
War" of the Temporal Cold War. It's a hot, proxy war zone of vengeance that is in
provides a place to test terrible weaponry and guerrilla tactics while somewhat
protecting the Prime timeline.

What better place for a hot war between proxies of time travelers than a bubble
universe entirely created for vengeance?

Time traveler involvement would also explain why the Kelvin timeline may be
diverging in time from the Prime timeline backwards from the Kelvin event as well.
It seems plausible that some of the Temporal Cold War hiccups we witnessed in
*Enterpise* were directly or indirectly related to stabilizing the Prime continuity
as the Kelvin timeline retroactively severs itself into a tighter bubble dimension.

I can even imagine that the analogy to the Vietnam War is somewhat intentional
by Orci and Kurtzman. After all, the title of *Star Trek Into Darkness* does
point to the riff on *Heart of Darkness* that was eventually buried alive and mostly
suffocated in subsequent drafts [^6], best known as the book that inspired
*Apocalypse Now*.

[^6]:
    Hash-tag Boycott Damon Lindelof script drafts. My own personal vengeance arc
    born of pain from *Star Trek Into Darkness* and *Prometheus* that will probably
    take too long to go nowhere and end with a whimper of a Deus Ex Machina full of
    fantasy elements in a supposedly sci-fi setting. It was probably Purgatory the
    whole time.
