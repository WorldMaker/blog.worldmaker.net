title: 'Book of the Moment: InterWorld'
---

<p><em>InterWorld</em> is just awesome.  It fits in a very soft spot for me, resonating with quite a few of my favorite works plus a good number of my own works.  It's something of the Heinlein Juvenile that Heinlein might have written alongside his &quot;World Without End Quadrology&quot;.  It's almost, to forgive an awful metaphor, what one might expect from a <em>Harry Potter and the Princes of Amber: The Television Show</em>, albeit without being a mutant hybrid <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>.  It's the pilot episodes to the animated series of a young man discovering that he can walk through worlds, eventually signing up for an Army of alternate versions of himself.  Small echoes there of <em>The Man Who Folded Himself</em> with some of the pseudo-dualism of <em>The Longest Journey</em> thrown in.  The most difficult thing to the novel is that I at least would like to see it picked up for a few more seasons <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>.  A simple, fun &quot;juvenile&quot; adventure story with a twist of multiversal meta-physics.</p>

Now that the book is published, Neil Gaiman said that DreamWorks Animation has shown interest in this &quot;new novel&quot;...  Heh.</td></tr>
