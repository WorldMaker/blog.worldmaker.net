title: 'Enlark and the Future: Exploring "Casually Immersive"'
---
<p>I haven't yet written the &quot;Business Plan&quot;.  I'd rather not right one, but one of these days I probably will have to.  Even though I don't have the formal documentation I certainly have considered plans for the future.  I just recently mentioned <a class="reference external" href="http://www.enlark.com/">Enlark</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="/2007/aug/28/pax-enlark-announces-first-project/">opening gambit</a>, and I wanted to at least touch on where <em>I</em> see the company going in the mid-to-long term.  (This is personal speculation, there is certainly not exactly official stand point, yet.)  The first project, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pgdevkit.com/">Pink Godzilla Dev Kit</a>, is pretty firmly in what today people are calling the &quot;casual&quot; space.  Some developers quarrel with the term (and some studies are showing that &quot;casual players&quot; are anything but casual); I'm a bit more ambivalent towards the term.  I'm pretty happy with that.  &quot;Casual&quot; is a growing space and there are a lot of good things happening there.  There are much worse places to try to be, especially for a small start up.  I think there are two good rules in the current casual space that I would be applying regardless of the subject matter or the game.  Both rules boil down to Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS): the game should be easy to pick up and play and the game should be easy to put down should &quot;real life&quot; intervene.</p>
<p>The place I see Enlark pushing into and exploring, because it interests me, are some of the more immersive sides of the casual space.  I can't say that we'll be the first in that niche, as I think the &quot;casual industry&quot; is mostly about applying older game styles and ideas to new games.  (That is one of the reasons I prefer the &quot;Arcade&quot; term for the casual space...  In many ways the casual industry is about reintroducing the &quot;quarter eater&quot; style of games to both new and existing audiences.  The KISS rules of casual are very classic in this sense.)  I think there are a lot of old ideas and new ideas that can be brought to the table to build very interesting &quot;casually immersive&quot; games.  There's a wide range of what's possible, everything from the classic sort of &quot;easy to learn, hard to master&quot; style of games (such as board game challenges like chess, go, or even backgammon) to games that have a surprising depth of story/world-building behind the &quot;lens&quot; of a simple game style.  I think there is a lot of untapped potential in this case, some of which I've discussed before on my blog.</p>
<p>As an example, one sort of depth creation is what I call the &quot;risk example&quot;.  Risk at large is not very &quot;casual&quot; for a board game in that it is hard to put down, as such.  Playing the major rule sets of Risk takes hours, not to mention the setup time and match-making if that is an issue...  Risk in pieces is much simpler: make a few simple decisions at a time and wait for the consequences.  This isn't a new idea, there are sometimes elaborate Play-By-Email (PBEM) versions of just this sort of thing.  I think there are some interesting tools from the ARG world that can make these sorts of games all the more immersive, or at least integrated, into a person's world.  Just imagine Risk battles showing up in your RSS feed like any other news sources...  Then sending &quot;army maneuvers&quot; via text message during your lunch break...</p>
<p>The other sorts of immersion I can think of I'll leave for another post, or perhaps save for the actual doing of them.  This post has gotten long enough and I think I've illustrated my points.</p>
