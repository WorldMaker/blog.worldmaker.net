title: 'FYI: Kentucky Bike Laws'
---
This is a pet peeve of mine, but **every** bicyclist *and* motorist (car driver) should know, by heart, `the Bicyclists Rules of the Road for Metro Louisville`__.   Read it.  Read it again.  Learn it.  These rules *are not new* and if you have taken the drivers test in the state you have already been required to know it.

The main things you should know in Kentucky:

* Bicyclists CANNOT use sidewalks.  Period.
* Motorists MUST share the road with bicyclists.

Any driver that honks at bicyclists for using the lanes that they have as much of right to (not to mention are required to use) for "being slow" because the driver is an impatient prick should have their license suspended because they aren't following the rules of the road.

Anyway, I'm tired of getting swiped by bicyclists on the sidewalk who don't even have the common courtesy to warn pedestrians as they pass, much less the knowledge that they are breaking the law.
