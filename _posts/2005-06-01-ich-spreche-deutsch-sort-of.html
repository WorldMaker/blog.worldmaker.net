title: Ich spreche Deutsch!  (Sort of...)
---
<p>Started a new class today (Intensive German 1)...  learned that if I felt like switching my third term summer class I could have a definite minor (in 10 weeks, total...  hurrah for Liberal Arts) and if I felt really desperate and sick of school I would probably only be a few credits from a BA in German.  Not that I'm planning to do such a thing, but I can't seem to shake that feeling that I'm going to be here forever, and reassurance from the A&amp;S school that I really have been here for 4 years and that it hasn't been just a dream felt nice.</p>

<p>I also started a new diversion today.  Signed up for a 14 day EVE Online trial.  This will be another MMOG vacation I can add to my list.  Like Matrix Online, I don't think I'm going to stay.  EVE Online is beautiful and well put together for the space genre, but the problem is that without the arcade dogfighting (sure its unrealistiv, but it is fun) and even with the added RPG elements (skills, attributes) it just doesn't excite me as much as some of my earlier favorites (Freespace 2).  Of course, I'm not sure I ever really got into the trading/ship-building aspects of the games.  I've always been a story guy, I guess.</p>
