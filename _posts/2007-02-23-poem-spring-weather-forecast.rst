title: 'Poem: Spring Weather Forecast?'
---
I don't write poems that often.  I love writing, particularly fiction, but poems so often seem forced and unnatural.  When I do write poetry it is often rather formless.  I can't keep metrics straight, I rarely rhyme, and I just generally prefer the sounds of alliteration to those of meter or rhyme.

I don't know how to describe this poem and I'm not sure if I want to say too much or too little.  I don't know where I am at the moment on anything.  Things are crazy right now.  Don't read it, because it probably isn't very good.  I post it here so that I won't forget it.

| I had become weary and nearly despondent
| The weather of my daily routine had become a dismal gray sleet
| Sometimes I donât know who I am or why I do what I do
| Sometimes I transmogrify leaden emotions into pure bathetic gold
| Up ahead I could see nothing but hail storms of responsibility

| All it takes is your smile and your laugh
| A ray of sunshine in my cramped calendar is all I ever want
| Sometimes I wish I could lose myself in the ocean of your eyes
| Sometimes I wonder what I must do to have the nerve to tell you
| Around you I donât notice the gray clouds in the sky

| Our deliberate gathering filled my days this week
| It was a heat wave of warm, low pressure winds to battle the cold
| Now I wish I had been able to ask sooner and had not been afraid
| Sometimes I wonder who I was to have been so naÃ¯ve
| I resolve to actually pursue my feelings rather than shy away

| I am not a fortune teller and have no psychic skills
| I can but predict the rain ahead and must not be afraid to seek the sun
| Now I can see naught before me but a chaos of spring storms 
| Sometimes I forget it is up to me to try to break the clouds
| But does it take a Goddess to truly control the weather?
