<p>I had a much longer post written, but I lost it because I'm an idiot.  Probably a good thing because it did contain some almost nasty insults to critics and ninja lovers.  In a nutshell, I think the third film cements this trilogy as a modern classic.  I loved it.</p>
<p>I still think it needed allusion to Wagner's <em>Flying Dutchman Overture</em>, but not much else to complain about.</p>
