I have long loved [darcs](http://darcs.net), but it's never really been in vogue and the tools in the git ecosystem
have sadly surpassed those available to darcs. I'm certainly using git a lot more often in the last few months than
any other VCS...

I just exported (using the about to be released darcs 2.10) three of my more interesting darcs repositories to git:

* [musdex](http://github.com/WorldMaker/musdex)
* [Debtstack](http://github.com/WorldMaker/Debtstack)
* [tokdiff](http://github.com/WorldMaker/tokdiff)
