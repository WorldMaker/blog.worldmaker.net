<p class="first admonition-title">September's Topic</p>

<p class="last">This month's topic is the intersection of Hollywood and Video Gaming
most notably (or disappointingly) the wild world of video game
adaptations of films.</p>
</div>
<p>In <a class="reference" href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/2008/jul/01/cutscenes-and-interactive-movie-blight-blogs-round/">my followup to my own post in the June round table</a> I wandered
around some of the topics of Hollywood and Video Gaming and there's a
pretty good core mantra that I think bears repeating:</p>
<blockquote>
The thing to learn from the &quot;interactive movie&quot; mess is not that
&quot;interactive movies are bad&quot;, it's that you can almost shoehorn a bad
game into a good movie (Dragon's Lair) and you can certainly cross a
good game with a good movie (Wing Commander 3 and UAKM), but do not
ever think that it is a good idea to make a bad movie more palatable
by shoehorning in a bad game to the experience. We learn that
Hollywood fails to understand gaming as far back as the early 90s and
that smart game companies can build good games that make use of
Hollywood know-how to intertwine good movies into the gameplay.</blockquote>
<p>It's about interactive movies, but I think the general principles are
sound and pretty applicable to the entire intersection of Hollywood and
Video Gaming.  Both are subtly different art forms with almost widely
divergent (but co-evolved from similar roots) tools.  Mistakes happen
when one or the other side underestimates the other, or tries to
bludgeon their way through the other art with nothing more than a tight
deadline and lots of cash.</p>

<p>Let me tell an allegory of two games: Long, long ago in a Californian
city far, far away (to me right now, at least) was a company founded by
a well to do Hollywood gentleman.  This company had a vast and easy
profit center in the gentleman's vault and chose to farm that profit
center to other developer's in order to better experiment with original
titles, using the easy royalties from licensing and publishing to fund
the original stuff.  There came a day when that gentleman and his
compatriot embarked upon the journey of filming a third film in a
well-regarded series about an adventurer and his radio serial-like
exploits.  The gentleman asked his company to produce a game worthy of
the film and his compatriot, a lover of games in his own accord, agreed.
The company choose to make two titles; one following the company's
existing modus operandi was given to another developer to be a populist
expression of the &quot;action&quot; side of the film, and the other was done in
house, with usage of almost all of the company's resources and made use
of the company's cache of originality and took a wider view of the
project, including more attempt to capture the wittier, more intelligent
side of the adventure.  The first game is better forgotten and the
second a classic.</p>
<p>For those not good with allegorical parables, the company here is
LucasArts and the games are <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em> and
it's &quot;Action&quot; companion.  Both were made under the same tight movie
deadline, but as I said one is easily a classic and the other is easily
forgotten.  I think there's a lot to say about film adaptations simply
from examining the difference between these two games.  The Action game
was a clone of the mechanics of some other action game at the time with
a loose connection to the film.  The Adventure game pushed just about
all of LucasArts' talent at the time to get it out the door on time, but
rather than do just the bare minimum necessary for the title the passion
of a team honed on original properties went nearly full bore on the
project and the creativity invested in the project shows, particularly
in its influence on later titles.  (Among other things <em>Last Crusade</em> is
the first LucasArts appearance of the now ubiquitous dialog tree.)  The
adventure title is arguably one of the first, and the few, good
adaptations of a film.</p>
<p>Rather than ramble further on a game that I admittedly don't know as
well as I should, I encourage you to read <a class="reference" href="http://www.mixnmojo.com/features/read.php?article=lastcrusade">Mixmojo's Secret History of
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>.  While you are at it, you may
find the other articles in the Secret History series fascinating and
enlightening.</p>
