<p>Once again taking a break from <i>Wicked</i> I cracked open <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743498844/worldmakeronl-20">Against the Tide</a>.  This book is the third in John Ringo's Council Wars mythos.  In <a href="/node/40">Emerald</a> <a href="/node/87">Sea</a> Ringo set up a large series of dominoes as its characters wove together the foundation for a continental navy.  In <i>Against the Tide</i> he immediately starts the domino chain reaction only to find that there were flaws in the chain and the naval forces suffer a huge defeat, partly to have the fun of repairing this navy and re-readying for a second try.</p>
