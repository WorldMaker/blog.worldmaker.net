title: "Merchant Voyages Are The Highest Stakes in *Sea of Thieves*: Respect Them"
tags: [games]

I've heard several pirates openly mock the Merchant Voyages in *Sea of Thieves*,
claiming them to be useful only for bored solo players for "easy" or "low risk"
work.

Nay, I tell you! For Merchant Voyages are the highest stakes in the game, and are
truly endgame. The toughest pirates of them all are the ones that fear no snake,
and always deliver on time.

Merchant Voyages are the only voyages that have left me angry enough to ragequit,
multiple times, so it's possible I'm just defensive.

# Narratively the Highest Stakes

In *Sea of Thieves* there are three trading companies ("factions") which offer you
Voyages, the most orderly quests for progression in the game. Of the three I think
it is plainly the Merchants that offer the highest stakes narratively speaking that
the game has to offer in organized play.

The *Gold Hoarders* seek to accumulate gold, and their voyages ask players to
find and dig up the loot of infamous NPC pirates. This is presumably, based
upon their name, to fill a giant vault somewhere in the sea so that some
pirates may dive into said vault to swim in it in the fashion of one Scrooge
McDuck. For all we know, the leader of the Gold Hoarders *is* Scrooge McDuck.
This is a fine goal, but a few coins lost to Davy Jones' locker or stolen by
some other pirate isn't going to slow things down very much or make the
existing hoard any less swimmable.

The *Order of Souls* asks pirates to hunt undead skeleton crews that haunt the
islands, so that they may study their magically infused skulls for Pirate Science.
This is absolutely laudable as a goal. Yet too, any one particular skull isn't
likely to advance the cause much, and skulls stolen by other pirates likely still
help the cause in the end. (Aside: given no obvious citrus fruits in the game,
perhaps it needs an *Order of Scurvy* to fight that dread problem?)

The *Merchants* voyages give you a request from some unseen NPC for an arbitrary
assortment of chickens, pigs, snakes, bananas, gunpowder kegs, etc. At first, these
seem like simple requests, and somewhat silly. But these requests want these things
by a certain date at a certain receiving island. It seems to me that these NPCs are
doing the best they can, with what resources available, to plan parties and feasts
in this age of sail. Each stolen gunpowder keg is one less fireworks display for
a party; each chicken ruthlessly murdered or sunk is one less meal at a feast.

I may pretend to be a heartless pirate sometimes in the game, but I *don't* want
to be the ruin of some kind stranger's party or feast. I take murdered chickens
very seriously, and that is why I have quit with the utmost of rage. You might
think the chickens are silly little annoyances, but these are the game's
toughest stakes. But you don't have to take my word for it, the game itself seems
to agree with me in its progression mechanics.

# Sea of Thieves Progression Primer

Because not everyone may have an intricate love/hate relationship with *Sea of
Thieves* allow me to provide a brief primer on its progression mechanics.

The core gameplay loop is simple: find objects and return them to the appropriate
trading company to progress most of the reward streams: gold, reputation, and
some of the available commendations/emblems. Gold is a currency stream to bootstrap
the gameplay loop and/or buy cosmetics. Reputation and commendations/emblems
unlock additional cosmetics for gold to buy.

Many of the objects you can turn into the trading companies may be found through
simply searching random islands and shipwrecks for them or thieving them from
other pirates.

The trading companies provide Voyages to direct this loop towards something a
little less aimless. For a nominal fee that increases with reputation-based
rank (and thus voyage complexity/risk/reward), Voyages offer specific object targets
to feed into the core gameplay loop. The remaining commendations/emblems are only
unlocked via Voyages.

I'd also argue that the simple Voyage Complete banner is the most satisfying
reward in the game.

# Merchant Voyages Have the Most Complicated Objects

Order of Souls Voyages direct you to specific islands to stumble into multiple
waves of skeleton pirates to fight until their named Captains show up. There
are some slight variations to the type of skeletons to fight: leafy pirates
are strengthened in water, gold pirates rust in water, and shadow pirates can
only be hurt in the light (of day, of a campfire, of a crew mate's raised lantern).
Kill skeletons. Collect the dropped skulls of dead named Captains. Rinse, repeat.

Gold Hoarders Voyages direct you to specific islands to dig up chests. Often this
is as simple as find the location of the X marked on the map and dig. (Fight any
skeleton waves that pop up.) Sometimes the complication is that the map is instead
a riddle which asks you to have some awareness of features of the island on which
you have already been directed, and count some paces from some of them.

Merchant Voyages request specific objects, but do not give you specific islands
where they might spawn. They are the only voyages that ask you have awareness of
chains of islands and relative island spawning populations. These objects are
complicated in further ways:

1. Pick up dependencies: You can't just pick up live animals, you need the
   appropriate coop, cage, or basket. You can't just sell bananas straight from
   the kegs in your ship's hold, you need a crate. Merchants on any outpost island
   will provide the first set of these dependency objects, but they spawn only
   irregularly on the islands themselves so replacing lost or stolen ones is
   complicated.

2. Care and feeding: Pigs need to be regularly fed bananas, or they whine and then
   die of (presumed) starvation. Snakes need to be handled with care, and like to
   be mollified with a sea shanty. Their spit is obnoxious to nearby pirates, and
   deadly to any other nearby animals.

# Merchant Voyages Are the Hardest to Progress

Order of Souls Voyages progress every time one of the named skeleton Captains is
killed. It does not matter even if it is you or your crew that kills that particular
Captain. The Voyage completes when all named skeleton Captains are killed. It does
not matter if any of the acquired skulls are actually turned in (by you or opposing
crews).

Gold Hoarders Voyages progress every time the requirements of a riddle stanza is
met, and every time a chest is dug up. The voyage completes when all chests are dug
up. It also does not matter if any of the acquired chests are actually turned in.

Merchant Voyages progress every time a requested item is sold to a specific Merchant
vendor on a specific named island. The voyage completes only when all items are sold.

Merchant Voyages have a due date. They are the only Voyages that have a failure state.

There are no intermediate progressions offered simply by collecting the needed items
on an island or in one's ship. Every stolen, murdered, or sunk item is a major setback
against a ticking clock.

# Merchant Pirates and Merchant Captains Are the Real Heroes

I think commendations/emblems for completing Merchant Voyages are the hardest rewards
in the game. I respect any pirate in *Sea of Thieves* that accomplishes that. I will
continue to laugh at any pirate that tells me they think Merchant Voyages are "easy".
Despite their silly cargo (chickens are definitely silly), they are the most taxing
and hardest to accomplish of the game's voyages. Eventually I suspect the taverns
will fill with the well-earned bravado of the toughest Merchants in the Sea, but
it may take some time for some folks to be swayed to agree. And sure, those tales
of bravado are still going to have their light-hearted moments of chasing pigs into
the ocean and playing lullabies for snakes, but for a pirate sometimes those are
best stories when you can get a laugh and build tension at the same time.
