title: 'A Proposed Alternative to PAX East: Come Visit ConGlomeration'
---

<p>For one key reason and a number of other more or less related reasons
there are many, including myself, that are very understandably angry at
<em>Penny Arcade</em> and are seeking to avoid one or both of this year's Penny
Arcade Expositions (PAX). However, I have come to highly value the great
community of people that I associate with PAX and think that it would be
a shame if the actual act of communal gathering were to disappear
altogether due to its association with recent events. To that end, allow
me to propose a new East Coast-ish venue as an alternative to PAX East
for us to convene outside of the shadow of influence of the Penny Arcade
corporation: <a class="reference external" href="http://conglomeration.info">ConGlomeration</a> on April 22-24 (Easter weekend
fortunately/unfortunately) in centrally-located Louisville, KY.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-conglomeration">
<h1>Why ConGlomeration?</h1>
<p>Admittedly I am biased as Louisville, KY is my hometown and my current
place of residence, but I've only attended ConGlomeration once (last
year) and I'm not currently involved in its operations (although that
will probably change; see below). What little experience I've had of the
convention and the awesome people that run it have given me confidence
that ConGlomeration is a perfect antithesis to our community's angst
with Penny Arcade and a great place to convene and to, well,
conglomerate. It won't be what we've come to know as PAX, but hopefully
in some ways it will be better. It certainly won't replace PAX for a
majority of people, and that's fine.</p>
<p>While the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.conglomeration.info/2009/10/about-conglomeration.html">About ConGlomeration</a> page, I think, makes a great case for
the convention, allow me to contextualize it with respect to our
community of once-PAX-attendees:</p>
<p>ConGlomeration is a <em>not-for-profit</em> convention with roots as a science
fiction and fantasy convention, but which picked up gaming and art and
whatever else fandom (in the niche subgroups sense) was interested in
(hence it became a melting pot or a <em>conglomeration</em> of fans).
ConGlomeration, unlike PAX, is run entirely by volunteers and they are a
wonderfully diverse and unique collection of great people who are doing
it for the love of a geeky community.</p>
<p>ConGlomeration is small, but spunky, and worth supporting. Moreover, I
think it is a good match for hosting our diverse community of gamers,
game developers, and everyone else that we enjoy seeing at PAX.
ConGlomeration, I feel, would be a very welcoming host (and is somewhat
in need of a strong attendance).</p>
<p>ConGlomeration seeks to remain a very <strong>family friendly</strong> environment
and the Committee and its volunteers are more than willing to show bad
elements where the door is.</p>
<p>ConGlomeration already has a 24-hour board and card gaming room, which
is one of the positive things I associate with PAX. It doesn't have the
programming that PAX has, but given that they are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.conglomeration.info/2009/10/programming-for-conglomeration-2010.html">crowsourcing
programming at ConGlomeration</a> I can see our community filling that
gap easily. I'm expecting/hoping to lead some efforts at programming
cool better-than-PAX things and would love whatever support I can find.
(Top of my list is to truly give <a class="reference external" href="http://www.deirdrakiai.com">Deirdra Kiai</a> the awesome hour she
requested-- I presume anyone that isn't already a fan of her work will
be at the end of said hour of awesome.) ConGlomeration seeks to equally
balance other areas like science fiction and fantasy so there is room to
stretch outside of &quot;traditional PAX topics&quot; as well if we have good
ideas.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-louisville">
<h1>Why Louisville?</h1>
<p>Granted that Louisville isn't as exciting as, say, Boston or Seattle, I
can promise you that it is a great host city. Louisville is <strong>the</strong>
biggest &quot;small city&quot; in the country. It is just Southern enough to
provide great Southern Hospitality and just Northern enough to temper
that with some refinement. Louisville is the western edge of the Eastern
time zone and a reasonable drive from much of the East Coast, Midwest,
and South.</p>
<p>Louisville is a big city with a great arts scene and many wonderful
museums. Particularly related to the discussions at hand, I believe, is
that I will make a recommendation to schedule some time to visit the Ali
Center which discusses issues of racial and religious tolerance.
(Although it is in the context of sports history, gaming may still have
a lot to learn from what it has to offer.)</p>
<p>Louisville knows how to host conventions. Louisville hosts many large
conventions every year (even if they aren't as exciting as PAX), and I
promise that it will happily host our community, even if it grows a lot
bigger (and I'd like to hope that it will).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="y-all-are-all-invited">
<h1>Y'all Are All Invited</h1>
<p>I'm going to spend some of the money that I was considering saving for
one or more PAX trips this year and grab at least one hotel room for
ConGlomeration and probably some other more direct means of supporting
ConGlomeration. I'd love to see many of y'all, my friends and internet
acquaintances, that feel similarly to join me.</p>
<p>I'm going to start immediately working on what I can do to build awesome
programming and help ConGlomeration prepare to host any and all that
wish to take up my offer. I know the hospitality rules of my city well
enough to know that offering this invitation has already made me an
implicit member of ConGlomeration's committee, and I will be working to
make that role explicit.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in joining me to work to make ConGlomeration a better
&quot;PAX&quot; than PAX (one without the PA) are more than welcome to email
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:me+conglomeration&#64;worldmaker.net">me+conglomeration&#64;worldmaker.net</a>.</p>
