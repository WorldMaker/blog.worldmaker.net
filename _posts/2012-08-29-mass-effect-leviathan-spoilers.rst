Thar be Spoilers belowdecks. Ye be warned.

For the most part I enjoyed the *Leviathan* DLC. However...

So here I am a mind-controlling tyrant just doing *what we do*: ruling the galaxy. I've noticed that several of my slave races have spent what little free time they have when not fulfilling my all-consuming commands enjoy tinkering with robotics. That would be neat if it weren't for the fact that every time a slave race manages to build some cool toys said toys are so unkind to their own masters they decide to wipe them out. Now, I'm not particularly worried about those toys turning on my kind --- because who doesn't love a good tyrant, am I right? --, I'm just pissed that the toys are killing *my slaves*: that's my hobby, they're taking all the fun out of being tyrant of the galaxy, you know. Unfortunately, I'm too busy controlling all of my other slave races to figure out some useful solution to this problem, so I'm going to go ahead and build a robot of my own and task it with solving this problem for me. This seems like the perfect sort of thing a robot could solve without screwing things up too much...
