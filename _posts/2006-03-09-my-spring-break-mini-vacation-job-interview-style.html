title: 'My Spring Break Mini-Vacation: Job Interview Style'
---
<p>It's only taken two+ years of work and effort, but I finally got noticed at Microsoft (thanks to Mark Brodsky and Craig Lichtenstein).  I'll be flying to Redmond, Washington next Wednesday.  Thursday will be Interview Day and then I'll have Friday to explore/play in the Seattle Area.  I'm not sure what I'll do, but I'm pretty good at improvising, and just like everywhere else there is good Coffee and good Beer to be had.  I'm hoping to land a coop/internship for my degree requirements...  we'll see how I do.  Microsoft's day-long interview process is notorious, but it should be fun.  That'll probably be my biggest problem: taking it seriously.  Then again, I'd rather be in a fun mood than an anxious mood.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm happy just landing the Interview.  What ever happens next is icing.</p>
