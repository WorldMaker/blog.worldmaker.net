<p>I've been on a Gibson catch-up kick lately and I've made my way
through to <em>Pattern Recognition</em> now.  I'm about a fourth of the way
through and enjoying it immensely.  Gibson's books are interesting
because there's an obvious closing of the gap between how far
out/fantastical his work and how contemporary his worlds seem.  I
think it's an obvious mix of maturity in his writing style and the
fact that the future is just catching up with him too fast...  Pattern
Recognition is interesting because it's almost a novel of examples
from some near future marketing textbook, and isn't boring in doing
so.  It involves a main character with an allergy to classic
trademarks <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> and revolves around what <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">Hugh</a> has been calling
&quot;Social Objects&quot;...  The idea of the marketing object not being a
one-way-street brand item like a logo or a trademark but something
intentionally designed to spark conversations and spread in the ways
that we speak to each other...  Plus, my copy of Pattern Recognition
in this case is itself a social object for me.  I found a hardcover
copy in Half-Price Books in amazing condition with what appears to be
Gibson's signature in it.  No idea how it ended up in a Half-Price
Books but I find it interesting to speculate.</p>
<p>I've decided that S3 via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jungledisk.com/">Jungle Disk</a> is the right &quot;set it and
forget it&quot; backup solution for me.  I've also been slowly moving some
of the more static elements of this website to my S3 storage as well.
I doubt anyone has much noticed that <tt class="docutils literal">media.worldmaker.net</tt> (and
thus all my CSS, JS, images on most pages) now is entirely S3 served.
Some times it's even faster than previously...</p>
<p>I finally moved the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.umphreys.com/">Umphrey's McGee</a> podcast from Google Reader
where it wasn't doing me much good to Banshee and...  wow.  The
podcast episodes now get mixed in with my normal crazy full-library
shuffle thing that I do and every one that I randomly end up on has
been just fantastic and well worth the cost of admission (free
podcast).  Makes me wonder if I own enough of their albums...  On the
other hand, their ranking on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.last.fm/user/WorldMaker/">my Last.fm profile</a> should shoot up
even further from all the podcast episodes...</p>

I've gotten to the point where my own auto-immune response to advertising seems almost like an allergy. Nowhere near as bad as the protagonist's, because mine manifests more in cynicism, derision, and tourette's...</td></tr>
