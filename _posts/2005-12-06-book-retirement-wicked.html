title: 'Book Retirement: Wicked'
---
<p>I just did something that is extremely rare for me: I just pulled the bookmark out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060987103/worldmakeronl-20">Wicked</a>.  I've had a bookmark in it for several months now (it was a <a href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/node/101">Book of the Moment</a> in May) and realized that I just didn't care to finish it.  It is an interesting character study, but it just doesn't have an interesting plot or much to say beyond an abstract painting of morality.  I would hope the musical is more interesting, but the book plodded too much and failed to keep my attention, which, again, is a rare thing for me.   I've had a bookmark in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743406443/worldmakeronl-20">Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars Volume 2</a> for even longer than I've had one in <i>Wicked</i>, and although it isn't apparently much of a page-turner of a read I still find the plot interesting enough to see where it leads in those rare occaisions I feel like reading it, and thus its bookmark stays.</p>

<p>It's about time for me to crack open a new book or two and post a new Book of the Moment...</p>
