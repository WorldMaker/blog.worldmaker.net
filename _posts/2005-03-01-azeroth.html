<p>Azeroth was one of my earliest attempts at a fairly large "metaverse", in which multiple universes played a role.  The main and major of these being named, itself, Azeroth and characterized of the destruction of an Earth-like planet named Azeroth, something about Unicorns, the formation of a great catalog, and the Volis who add to it.</p>
