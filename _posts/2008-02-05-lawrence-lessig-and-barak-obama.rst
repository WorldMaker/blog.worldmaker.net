title: Lawrence Lessig and Barak Obama
---
Lawrence Lessig, someone that I've come to trust as a fighter for decency and intelligence, put together a `20 minute persuasive video on why he supports Obama`__.  It's worth a watch.  (Lawrence Lessig has been Obama's adviser on technology-related issues, by the way.)

Lessig posted a little bit later a YouTube `music video of Obama's Yes, We Can speech`__.  Also worth a watch.

I haven't spent much time forming an opinion for the primary as Kentucky doesn't have much of a voice in the weird caucus system that we see today.  I do find myself leaning towards Obama over Clinton, particularly because of his involvement with Lawrence Lessig.
