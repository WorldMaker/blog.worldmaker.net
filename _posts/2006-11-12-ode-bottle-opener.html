title: Ode to a Bottle Opener
---
<p>This fall's bottle cap artwork is perhaps not as exciting as the previous beerrow, but these caps where a bit worse for wear due to my lost bottle opener.</p>
<p>In more exciting news, I got to see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.clearification.com/">Dmitri Martin</a> live last night at a small venue (The Showbox in downtown Seattle).  It was a good show, even though the &quot;seats&quot; weren't too great (a good portion of the venue was standing room only, making it somewhat uncomfortable for comedian watching, but probably more interesting for concerts).</p>
<p>I really like Dmitri Martin.  His trendspotting clips on the Daily Show have been pretty good, and he has a weird, yet relatively dry humor, which hits near a sweet spot for me.  His Comedy Central Presents special is good and I believe (I could be wrong), but when this current tour (&quot;These are jokes.&quot;) reaches New York they'll be taping it for a second Comedy Central Presents special.</p>
<p>The opening acts where good, too.  I believe I've seen the first, Irish comedian <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O'Doherty">David O'Doherty</a>, but I have no idea where that might have been other than I watch way too much Comedy Central stand-up.  The second, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1179485/">Leo Allen</a>, didn't stand out as too memorable between the sandwich of whimsy that was DOD and Dmitri.  The big thing I remember was that he was the creator of the many recent SNL skits about &quot;The Falconer&quot;, which are amusing at times, but I think that portions of his set gave me a few better insights into where that came from.</p>
