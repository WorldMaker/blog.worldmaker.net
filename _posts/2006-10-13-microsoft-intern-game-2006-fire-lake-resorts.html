<p>The write up for <a class="reference external" href="http://interngame.com/firelake/page.php">Fire Lake Resort</a> has been posted.  This was a crazy game weekend I took part of during the Summer the weekend before I flew back to Louisville from Redmond.  The game is perhaps hard to describe if you haven't experienced one, but basically it was a series of puzzles (described on the website's write up) that took place over a span of just about 48 hours (straight).  We competed in teams of generally 6 to 8.  My team formed pretty well in advance and we got fairly involved into the pre-game puzzles and the application's &quot;vacation resume&quot;.   (My <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/firelake/">Fire Lake flickr group</a> was created as a part of the vacation resume.)  A good number of us all worked in the same building and thus worked in Business Solutions.  The Crayola color name for our team was a Grayish-Brown color called &quot;Shadow&quot;.  I was informed that we in Team Shadow placed 2nd (of I believe 13) in the overall standings for the game, which is pretty impressive.</p>
