<p class="first admonition-title">January's Topic</p>

<p class="last">What if a great book had resulted as an adaptation of a video game?</p>
</div>
<p>I wanted to spend some time revisiting the mainstream accord that Roger
Zelazny in particular brought to gaming.  As a gonzo journalist of our
esteemed past-time he did much to illustrate to the common person how
much our entertainments and mere <em>games</em> in fact delve deep into the
human condition; all the while combining and remixing and transcending
art and literature.  I particularly wanted to spend some time again
dwelling on the works that most caught the imaginations of game players
and non-gamers alike, his large series popularly referred to as the
<em>Amber</em> chronicles.</p>
<p>Regardless of your stance on the <em>Amber</em> role-playing meta-guild and its
mischief across the spaces of several game worlds, with the tacit
approval of the world designer we refer to only as <em>Oberon</em>--
Regardless of what you think of the griefer meta-guild <em>Chaos</em> and it's
politics--  Regardless of where you were in any of the many chronicled
battles or meetings or political events-- I think we can all agree that
Zelazny's prose elevates such discussions to the stage of true
literature.  Many of us may still debate such things as we are wont to
do, but all of us proudly flaunt whatever involvement we may have
played; we all eke what little fame, celebrity, or renown that we can
from the shadow of the popularity Zelazny's writing has acclaimed.</p>

<p>Certainly Zelazny had tremendous luck to be as involved as he was in
this long saga, now so indelibly etched into the hearts of us gamers.
I know that I certainly wish I had been lucky enough to know Oberon at
that apex of his career.  How can anyone not envy the cross-server
super-user powers Oberon gave to his so-called &quot;sons and daughters&quot;?
That they would band together to &quot;abuse&quot; their powers, and don't get me
started on that particular debate, is just about inescapable.  That they
would have the foresight and skill to do so with the role-playing spirit
and panache that they had is beyond surprising.  (I certainly believe
that Oberon played a deeper role in that than he ever gave himself
credit for.)  That we would have anywhere near as wonderful a bard to
recount the tales of the guild nearly as they happened is extraordinary.</p>
<p>I know that many gamers still hold against Zelazny that he wrote things
from solely his perspective in the events, and particularly because he
often simplified events and motivations from the &quot;real&quot; events that so
many of us participated in... and yet, I think more often than not his
works enriched our discourse across the entire spectrum.  Zelazny's
research into the literary references of the various worlds and player
handles alone enlightened us to some of the hidden richness of a few of
our fondest playgrounds.  I don't think many of today's debates on the
subject would have survived without some of Zelazny's memorable passages
to anchor them.  Just imagine if all we had were oral histories and
slowly bit-rotting chat logs to save our history of such grand events...</p>
<p>I hate to end on that sour note, but I also can't forget the great
shutdown of Oberon's world servers.  I know many of us wish that we
could return to the worlds we still debate over, as much or more than
Zelazny's non-gamer fans are left wondering where the story might have
gone given the chance for a more natural conclusion.  If we are to best
honor Zelazny's legacy to gaming we should endeavour to continue trying
to preserve gaming's own legacy in forms that will bring new
gamers into the fold nearly as well as Zelazny himself did.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Roger Zelazny contributed to video games, both directly and indirectly,
in many ways throughout his career and I hope that he might appreciate
the alternate history that I painted above, should there be some
alternate universe where he might read it.  I've long asserted that some
of the most interesting storytelling that can come from games is in the
social and political cross-play.  Given the right sandbox(es) I think
that great stories can arise purely out of the players.  Given the right
players I think great literature can result that will stand the tests of
time and span the boundaries between gaming and the mainstream...</p>

<p><em>Amber</em> was the obvious choice to compare to these assertions of mine.
The Amber chronicles are as much about political machinations as they
are about large wars between too-powerful groups.  The Amber chronicles
also span the boundary between fantasy and science fiction; technology
takes a larger and larger role throughout the series and the entire
series seems to rely upon or play with the many worlds interpretation of
quantum mechanics.  The Amber chronicles also span the boundary between
&quot;genre fiction&quot; and &quot;mainstream literature&quot;.  The books forthrightly
acknowledge many of there references to earlier literature.  I think
Roger Zelazny's books certainly stand the test of being both great
literature and great science fiction/fantasy.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest influence on my choice, however, are from what I
recall of some of the Amber-influenced MUSHes and MUCKs.  I remember
chancing upon a somewhat detailed report of one MU*'s attempt to
role-play past the ending of the series and come up with something
compelling for a real conclusion through individual players playing a
panoply of relatives and covers of the characters in the book.  I read
this page many years ago and remember being inspired by the passion all
of these people put into their creations and remixes and recreations.  I
have a suspicion that the particular page has probably fallen to the
bit-rot that certainly has eaten whatever bookmarks I might have had to
it, and I'm hesitant to go searching for such a page and ruin whatever
illusions I might have.</p>
<p>I've wondered before what things might be like if some of those
multi-user endeavours had preceded the book, and maybe my take on it
above might proffer some interesting thoughts on the subject.  I feel
somewhat guilty of &quot;phoning it in&quot; for this round table, considering
that with the vast richness of literature at my disposal I returned to a
topic close at hand.  Perhaps why I put as much work into my alternate
history text above as I did.</p>
<p>My original challenge to myself was to try imagining a game that might
precede Zelazny's <em>The Dream Master</em>.  I think I'm going to leave that
subject there for the moment and maybe return to why that book is both
particularly well suited to the topic and particularly challenging...
The alternate history above could nearly use contemporary technologies
to the novels and be compelling.  (I believe that at least one of the
Amber MU*s predates several of the books in the series and I'm curious
if Telarium's <em>Nine Princes of Amber</em> is worth seeking a copy of.) <em>The
Dream Master</em> just about mandates technologies that don't exist.  Feel
free to discuss <em>The Dream Master</em> in the comments below if you have
read it, however, and are more interested in discussing it than the
better known <em>Amber</em> works...</p>
