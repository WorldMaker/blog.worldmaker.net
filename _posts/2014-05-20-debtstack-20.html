title: Debtstack 2.0
---
<p>I'm calling the latest release of Debstack version 2.0 as it is a fairly
big rewrite compared to the original version. (<a class="reference external" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3936701/Debtstack.zip">Debtstack binaries</a>;
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.worldmaker.net/2012/apr/29/introducing-debtstack/">Introductory blog post on Debtstack</a>; <a class="reference external" href="http://debtstack.code.worldmaker.net">Current Debtstack code site</a>)
The big deal with this rewrite is it now uses a mostly <strong>immutable</strong>
data model, plus a couple of basic new features.</p>
<div class="section" id="immutable-model">
<h1>Immutable Model</h1>
<p>I realized that from the beginning I should have built Debtstack on top
of a strongly immutable model, and its part of why I chose F# as the
language to begin with. (I of course didn't quite follow through on that
initially.) It really seems like the <em>right way</em> to go for this project,
not least because provides better insight into how the algorithms work
and easier debugging and asynchronicity, but more importantly because
when dealing with financial data (even just for a read only viewer like
Debtstack) it makes sense to try as much as possible never, ever, lose
information or even to change things without a log of the change. It hit
me early on in this particular rewrite process that essentially the
immutable model that I'm using is an interesting (and logical) extreme
form of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system">double-entry accounting</a>. I'm pleased at the idea that the
code now largely resembles a long-standing accounting best practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-features">
<h1>New Features</h1>
<p>Most of the new features exist largely because the new data model
facilitates them.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Transaction details</dt>
<dd>Transactions now have an inspection window showing the complete
breakdown of how the chosen algorithm affected them, by
double-clicking them in the &quot;Open&quot; list up top or clicking the
&quot;Details&quot; button in the grid of Closed items.</dd>
<dt>&quot;Naive&quot; algorithm</dt>
<dd>I refer to this as the &quot;But You Don't Have to Take My Word For It&quot;
button. This presents the view everyone tends to calculate in their
head when looking at a recent statement. This is the simple <em>first in,
first out</em> queue view that the other two algorithms are designed to be
more interesting in comparison to. I didn't see a use for it in the
old version, but with the new immutable model it is a bit more
interesting and a bit more useful to directly compare the results.</dd>
<dt>Date filtering</dt>
<dd>After choosing one of the algorithms to look at, you can now filter it
back in time to see historical views (&quot;What did my balance look like
last month?&quot;, for instance).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evolutionary-tangents">
<h1>Evolutionary Tangents</h1>
<p>This version swaps <tt class="docutils literal">ImpromptuInterface.MVVM</tt> for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reactiveui.net/">ReactiveUI</a> and (my)
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WorldMaker/ReflexUX">ReflexUX</a>, but neither is all that strongly used (because they don't
really need to be, largely in part due to the new immutable data model)
and for the moment the difference between the two dynamic MVVM backends
is a wash for this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="full-disclosure">
<h1>Full Disclosure</h1>
<p>Since writing version 1.0 of Debtstack, I'm now employed by a credit
card processing company. Debtstack is a hobby project for my own
personal use and amusement. So far as I know the company I work for has
no interest in Debtstack and certainly does not endorse it (and probably
knows nothing about it). This project and any opinions espoused about it
are entirely my own.</p>
<p>I don't think it matters to actually disclose it, and Debtstack has zero
to do with the area of the company that I work in (Sales software), but
it seemed somewhat relevant, and also I feel special now because I've
never really felt I needed a full disclosure for some bit of Open Source
work before.</p>
