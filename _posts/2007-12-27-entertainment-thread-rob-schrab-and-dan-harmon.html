title: 'Entertainment Thread: Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon'
---

<p>It's a small entertainment world, particularly the actually funny, weird stuff.  Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon seem to be pretty cool, weird and funny guys.  Co-founders of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.channel101.com/">Channel101</a> and involved in an interesting list of projects including <a class="reference external" href="http://robotbastard.robschrab.com/">Robot Bastard</a>, <em>Heat Vision and Jack</em> (apparently a feature-film is in the works), and <em>The Sarah Silverman Show</em>.  I finally cleared Doug TenNapel's (creator of much of <em>Earthworm Jim</em> and <em>The Neverhood</em>) graphic novels out of my Amazon wishlist and onto my shelf and Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon are credited for bringing him into comics.  It was weird when I finally noticed their credits in <em>The Sarah Silverman Show</em>, which I think is the best actual sit-com in years.  I turned to my brother when I noticed it and said, &quot;Yeah, you remember, those were the guys that did <em>Laser Fart</em>.&quot;</p>
