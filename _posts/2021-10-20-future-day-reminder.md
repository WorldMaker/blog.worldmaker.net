title: Tomorrow is Future Day 2021 (Positive Sixth Annual)
tags: [films, future-day]

October 21st each year I like to order a pizza and a Pepsi from
Pizza Hut, watch all three _Back to the Future_ films, and think about
"The Future". I call it **Future Day**. It's a relatively simple holiday
to celebrate every year, and I've celebrated it for decades. October
21st, 2015 was the date that Doc takes Marty McFly and Jennifer to
visit their future. I've always counted the holiday from 2015, so this
will be the (Positive) Sixth Annual Future Day, even though I've celebrated it
for decades at this point. I even went so far as to post the idea to
Facebook and invite guests to my place to hang out and marathon
_Back to the Future_ with me for a few years early in owning my current
home. I don't remember the exact years offhand, but that would have
started sometime round the Negative Fourth Annual.

Ordering a pizza and a Pepsi from Pizza Hut is easy enough to do. I
deeply associate these specific foods/drinks with the holiday for many
reasons. It was sometimes the food pairing of choice when watching the
films on VHS as a kid. It's also the product placement meal inside of
_Back to the Future Part II_, though I still don't have a
Black & Decker Food Rehydrator with which to reheat my dehydrated pizzas.
(Just the regular delivery of hot pizzas in cardboard boxes.)

Watching all three _Back to the Future_ films is definitely a marathon
and not a sprint, so it's not quite as easy as it sounds. The few years I invited
guests over, very few guests made it all the way through
_Back to the Future Part III_. Sometimes that's just because fewer people
appreciate _Part III_. (In my opinion you can't watch _Part II_
without watching _Part III_. That's only watching half the movie.)
Often it's because the 21st tends to fall on a weeknight (it was a
Wednesday in 2015, it's a Thursday in 2021) and people couldn't stay
up that late and it was tough to start earlier.

Thinking about "The Future" is the part that's supposed to be hard.

The movies spark some obvious conversations, especially now that we
are in positive annual celebrations. Obviously we didn't get
hoverboards nor hover car conversions (though as
_Back to the Future Part II_ is quick to point out such things don't solve traffic, they
just make it worse). But there's subtle things it got quite right like
the cyclical return of '80s nostalgia in 2015 and interesting
predictions about smartphone tech though it generally got the form
factor wrong (glasses and visors rather than hand tablets). Compared
to the so called "curse" of the film _2001_,
_Back to the Future Part II_ did a much better job picking brands that remained (mostly)
relevant/existing into the real 2015. Black & Decker still existed in
2015 though much less prominent in American life with the
dismantlement of Sears. It was also rebranded Black+Decker in 2014,
so the ampersand on the Rehydrator would have been an interesting throwback
or an older model than 2015. (Because ampersands are too polite/old fashioned
for appliances or something? I don't understand rebrands sometimes.)
JVC was sold by Panasonic and merged with Kenwood in 2008 and the combined company
JVCKenwood moved to focusing on the Kenwood brand name in America and
it was relatively unlikely to buy JVC branded stuff in 2015 other than
for nostalgia, mostly. (Possibly explained by Marty working for a
Japanese conglomerate.)

But something that the Back to the Future movies do particularly well,
I think, in the "got subtle things quite right" department is the
respect for what today we often refer to as "Gibson's Law", named
today for sci-fi author and the ur-provocateur of the cyberpunk genre
William Gibson is the observation/realization that "the future is
already here, it is just unevenly distributed". It's not a unique
observation, William Gibson helped give it a better name. In
furnishing and set designing the Hill Valley of the 1950s the Back to
the Future filmmakers realized they needed to mix in 1920s/1930s cars
and furniture and architecture and in general span several decades of
brands and fashions and building designs to make the town feel real. A
lot of that same eye was applied to the Hill Valley of 2015: most of
the bones are the same as 1950s (and the decrepit no one is downtown
in the town square much any more 1980s Hill Valley) of course, but
they also applied changes they were already seeing in the early 1990s
when they were filming and things like '80s nostalgia cafe both made
it easier for them to dress sets, but also fit exactly the sort of
thing that really happens within the fabric of cities. The antique
shop selling a "classic" Dustbuster (another Black+Decker brand that still exists,
though generally surpassed by "fun" modern brands like "Shark hand vaccuum"),
and the alleyway full of trashed Laserdiscs their own similar
statements.

Things don't just "light switch on/off" into a new state: progress is
gradual and spread thinly across early adopters, upper classes, and variable adoption
curves. The future is already here, it is just unevenly distributed.

Contemplating Gibson's Law on Future Day I find a useful
exercise/reminder. I appreciate that it is hard. I want to appreciate
all the little and big things we take for granted "living in
_this_ future" and all the little and big things we will likely take for
granted tomorrow in whatever that future may bring. (Gibson's Law
would remind us we probably even know what that is/will be: it's
likely already out there in some rich person's hands right now. What
do you think they are doing with it?)

Gibson's Law reminds us that "The Future" doesn't really just shock us and
appear all of a sudden: it's a lot more
like the oft-mentioned boiling frog analogy, because it just creeps up
on us all slowly over time as it's mostly already here, it just may
not be distributed or only thinly distributed to us just yet. (Whether
as the boiling frogs in this analogy this is healthy, is a deep and
long question, and arguably a key question to a lot of cyberpunk
writing.)

The last couple of years because of COVID we've all heard and used and
groaned at and then tried to reclaim and then tried to dustbin and
then had to pick back up the term "the new normal". Whatever stage of
grief, acceptance, and/or disdain you find yourself with that phrase right
now, that phrase itself is an embodiment of the hard parts of Future
Day. What is the new normal that has snuck and whelmed its way into our lives?
What do we want it to be? What do we recognize we have no way to control
about it? How do we control whatwe do have access to for the better? How
do we look forward to it with optimism rather than fear?

I made up this silly holiday because I loved the _Back to the Future_
movies and as an annual excuse to put my rewatch marathon on the
calendar, on an interesting date that's mentioned in the movie, and on
the sort of mid/late-Fall day (weeknight aside) where curling up with
a pizza and watching three movies back to back feels like it makes a
lot of sense. Yet it is years especially like this one, the second
Future Day after March 2020 and the multiple "new normals"â€“creating
pandemic that the hard challenge I gave myself to make the personal
holiday _mean something_ seems ever more crucial, ever subtly harder,
and I suppose a lot more meaningful.

If you get a chance, maybe grab a pizza and watch _Back to the Future_
tomorrow? At least contemplate "The Future" and how it is already here?
