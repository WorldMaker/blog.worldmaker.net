<p>I saw a sneak showing of <i>A Scanner Darkly</i> last night.  I thought it was great.  It really touched at a lot of the heart of the Phillip K. Dick novel and had some really good acting performances.  I was impressed by the animation and thought it did a lot to help keep the feel of the movie close to that of the book.  I'm definitely adding this movie to my DVD Collection.</p>
