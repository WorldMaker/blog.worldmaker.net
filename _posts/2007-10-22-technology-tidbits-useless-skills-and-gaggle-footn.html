title: Technology Tidbits, Useless Skills and a Gaggle of Footnotes
---
<p>First of all, Gutsy Gibbon (Ubuntu 7.10) has a few small improvements
that are already nice things for me.  The big thing is I was running
an older copy of Beryl and the Compiz Fusion bundled with Gutsy is
noticeably improved in a few areas.  Chief among them is it works like
a charm in suspend/hibernate.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id1">[1]</a>  Also, fullscreen windows are
remembered correctly <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id2">[2]</a> and the bars don't overlap the window as
often.</p>
<p>Second of all, I'm still not sure I'm entirely sure what I'm doing,
but I broke down and bought an HD-DVD drive for my nice 720p+Xbox 360
setup.  At BestBuy I got the drive's worth of free movies to go with
it.  So I watched <em>Transformers</em> tonight <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id3">[3]</a> and I got <em>Batman
Begins</em> waiting <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id19" id="id4">[4]</a>, both free at checkout.  I got a raincheck from
them for my free copy of <em>Heroes</em> Season 1 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id5">[5]</a>, as they had just ran
out when I got there <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id22" id="id6">[6]</a>.  I've got a rebate for 5 more discs out of
a more strict selection that I'll mail shortly. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id23" id="id7">[7]</a>  <em>King Kong</em> (Peter Jackson's recent remake) came in the box with the player and I look forward to watching that for the first time. Now I just need a surround sound receiver and I'll be all set.</p>
<p>So the past couple of days I've been thinking of some of my currently
&quot;useless&quot; skills.</p>
<p>I can swirl a professional looking ice cream cone from soft-serve
machines.  Possibly one of the most important things I learned in a
summer and a half of theme park food service, and not that tough to
learn nor that useful other than as a fun parlor trick <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id25" id="id8">[8]</a> with
those ice cream machines that every buffet in the country is required
by a law of nature to have.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id26" id="id9">[9]</a>  10 year old girls find it amazing
when you have a good looking, tall ice cream cone.  Maybe some day
I'll find someone closer to my age that's easily impressed by feats of
dairy dexterity.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id27" id="id10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Another useless talent to me is my nearly eidetic memory for music
lyrics.  Most days it merely serves as an annoyance as it makes me
more susceptible to earworms <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id28" id="id11">[11]</a> than the average person.  But I can
do some amazing feats of Karaoke if I'm drunk enough.  I just try not
to drink too much in or around Karaoke bars for fear of being expected
to repeat a performance.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id30" id="id12">[12]</a>  I figure I could attempt to attract a
mate with this talent <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id31" id="id13">[13]</a>, but other than cruising disturbing nests
of Karaoke warbling I have no idea how to do it. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id32" id="id14">[14]</a></p>
