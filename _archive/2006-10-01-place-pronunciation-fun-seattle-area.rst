title: 'Place Pronunciation Fun: Seattle Area'

I get a lot of flack at my lazy native pronunciation of Louisville.  (If you don't what I'm talking about you can generally find a sportscaster that finds great national coverage-worthy humor in asking "Am I pronouncing that right?" a few times, particularly during national Derby coverage in May.)  So, I feel vindicated in finding great humor in the fact that the place spelled Puyallup is pronounced more like "Pee-wollop".
