title: 'Deal or No Deal: Truly a Lottery'

In case anyone cares:  I just finished a 25-page paper in which I showed statistically that the banker has an impact on the results of a game of *Deal or No Deal*, but the contestants **do not**.  I'll post a PDF or XPS of the paper tomorrow, perhaps.  I primarily wasn't testing contestants, so it is possible that my random sampling of contestants was biased and there exists contestants for which there is a statistically significant difference and all of my participants just happened to be very equally matched.  I'm a little doubtful, though.
