title: 15 Sentences of Wikipedia Fame

Beyond `some fairly mediocre contributions <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=WorldMaker>`_, I haven't made a huge dent yet in the English Wikipedia, and I've mentioned that before.

I've been getting a fair amount of hits from that usage.

As a note to myself, and a potential way to guide potential contributions, I should join the `Louisville WikiProject <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Louisville>`_ when I get a chance...
