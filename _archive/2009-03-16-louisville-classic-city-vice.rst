title: Louisville as a Classic City of Vice
---
On the heels of my own post referring to Derby, I was referred to an `article at The Urbanophile about Louisville marketing itself as a Vice City`__ (via `Broken Sidewalk`_) and in commenting chanced upon `this spirited ad for Louisville`_. I certainly think "Just Add Bourbon" is a more interesting slogan than "Possibility City". Oddly enough, the ad appears to be from GLI's [1]_ Community Branding Project, or at least it's on one of their YouTube accounts.  Needless to say, I think there is some benefit in chasing after a more Vice-filled "New Orleans of the North" campaign.
