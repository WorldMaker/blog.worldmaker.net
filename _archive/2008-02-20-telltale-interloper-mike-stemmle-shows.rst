title: 'From the Telltale Interloper: Mike Stemmle shows up'
---
Mike Stemmle is quite the legend in game writing for his credits on *Sam and Max: Hit the Road* and even *Escape from Monkey Island* (yes, it had good writing once you realized that it wasn't a Ron Monkey Island, much less a true sequel to the non-Ron Curse that would have been nice to have).  This is great news for Telltale as the number of crazy funny writers that understand adventure game writing increases.

Unfortunately I'm assuming this is bad news for *Star Trek Online*.  I knew the rumors have said that the project is all but dead, but considering that Mike Stemmle as STO head writer was one of the key things that gave me any hope at all for the project in the first place...  It's certainly dead to me now if it has lost a talented head writer.
