I'm worried because I think these `photoshopped Grindhouse Posters`__ (insert usual Something Awful NSFW and BFTS [#]_ link disclaimer) really do go to show that the movie-going experience could be a lot more exciting if the studios went back to "thrilling posters" and gave up on "let's show every important scene in the movie" trailers.
