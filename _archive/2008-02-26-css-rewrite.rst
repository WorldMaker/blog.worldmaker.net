title: CSS Rewrite
---
I rewrote the CSS that I was using using the YUI_ stack of foundational CSS files.  For the most part I've been happy with the theme itself, but it had a few quirks and I've always preferred to write my own rather modify someone else's CSS.  This rewrite affords me some interesting new design flexibility.  (For instance, the Code_ pages now have a real sidebar.)   I'm continuing to tweak and have a few plans for the new design flexibility...  primary among those is I'm contemplating switching to a threaded style of comments once more.

Some intentional things you might notice changed with the new design: new logos, disappearance of the translucent version of the gear (I need to find some other way to bring the gear back, I think, I felt it was taking up too much space the old way), tabs have switched sides, new list bullet...

I'm making small adjustments and tweaks as I see them, but overall I think the rewrite appears to be a success...
