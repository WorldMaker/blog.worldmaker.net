title: Zero Punctuation on Peggle
---
I just noticed the `Zero Punctuation`_ `Peggle Review`_ and in addition to containing Yahtzee's normally acute observations and descriptions of the game it also includes some observations of Pop Cap itself.  I definitely agree with his characterization of the company as something now of a "big bully" in the space.  I apparently didn't mention it on my blog at the time, but during PAX '07 in August my opinion of Pop Cap shifted quite downward, into basically what Yahtzee points out, in my interactions with a few Pop Cap employees that were attending PAX to represent that company.

PS, If Zero Punctuation is new to you, you should watch some of his other reviews, particularly `the one on Psychonauts`__.
