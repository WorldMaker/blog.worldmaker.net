title: Showing off my story works...
---
I've had these pages around for a while, and I mentioned them before, but I finally added a big link to `my story works`_ from `my frontpage`_ and unlore_.  I might move those pages entirely to unlore, but I'm still debating that, but that would at least get some content there.  I kept hoping to "finish" those pages before adding links on the front pages, but I don't when I expect to be "done" and I've put it off long enough as it is.  (It was pointed out that those pages were "missing" by a relative when I realized that I still hadn't put front page links up.)  I'm not sure it'll ever be "done" anyway, due to the loss of my desktop hard drive a few months back.  Beyond lack of "finish"/"polish", there's still some other issues with the story pages:

* I'm not sure if I've cataloged every story in the archives of my blog.  I know that I don't have every story I've ever posted, but I also realize that I have that huge gap pre-2004.  I'm not sure if I'll ever get some of those stories back...
* Some stories are badly formatted due to database export and then re-import.  I'm not sure if I can fix that.  I might not have the original word docs anymore for some/all of them...  I could do it by hand (it's mostly bad punctuation), but that could take a while.
* I still haven't decided what to do with non-fiction/school projects that I've posted to the blog that might be worth highlighting.  At the very least, I'd still love any suggestions for "best of" blog articles that I should highlight.
