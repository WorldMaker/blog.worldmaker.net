First of all, I think Daft Punk's *Random Access Memories* is fantastic. Apropos to the album title, my mind starting free associating some praising with faint damnation, [1]_ and I thought it was funny enough to record here.

Basically, stupid stereotypes in my head believe that the French still think that Jerry Lewis is alive and funny and similarly Disco never died for them. (Look at the band Phoenix, perhaps.) So for Daft Punk this would probably be their most *contemporary* album to date. It's like how William Gibson slowly merged from the sci-fi vanguard into contemporary literature. Maybe this album is the musical equivalent of Gibson's Thesis, "the future is already here, it is just unevenly distributed... and full of disco."
