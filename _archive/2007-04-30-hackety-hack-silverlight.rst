title: 'Hackety Hack: Silverlight?'
---
Hey, remember when I was talking `about how the Xbox 360 is almost, just about, a killer platform for teaching coding to kids </2007/apr/28/hackety-hack-do-code-back/>`_?  Remember how I thought it was possibly just around the corner?  There are interesting new twists in this saga this week...

Following the coat-tails of Silverlight_ 1.0 Beta, Microsoft has just released the first public alpha version of Silverlight_ 1.1.  Crazy, huh?  The big difference is the one I had been expecting for some time: Silverlight 1.1 includes a cross-platform Compact Framework-like mini-CLR.  Here's the kicker of a huge surprise twist: Silverlight 1.1 also includes the first official alpha release of the `Dynamic Language Runtime`_.  IronPython (2.0), IronRuby, and Managed JScript are all going to be officially supported Silverlight languages.

First of all, I am curious as to how far away, then, DLR for the 360 is...

Second, with this announcement I think Silverlight becomes a potential killer platform for teaching coding skills with dynamic languages in the Hackety Hack vein: easily deployable via the web (small cross-platform toolkit [#]_), powerful "real" languages, good young people-friendly sandboxing...

XAML isn't a bad alternative to XHTML, either.

.. [#] I realize the small exception the Microsoft still hasn't promised a Linux version of Silverlight...  Hopefully that's an oversight that will be corrected shortly.  Just to start further rumors, because I can, I have a sneaking suspicion that the Xbox and Zune may show up as Silverlight platforms as well...
