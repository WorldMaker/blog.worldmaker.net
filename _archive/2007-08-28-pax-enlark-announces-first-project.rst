title: 'PAX: Enlark announces first project...'
---
PAX_ 2007 was huge and very enjoyable personally.  There were quite a few highlights and major announcements that came out of PAX and are better publicized elsewhere.  I spent much of the time I was there officially introducing people to Enlark_ and trying to network, or at least get early feedback.  It was the first time it was publicly announced that Enlark's first project is in working with `Pink Godzilla`_ to bring the `Pink Godzilla Dev Kit`_ to the PC for online multiplayer action.

For the non-PAX attendees in my readership: Pink Godzilla is a unique video games emporium in Seattle's international district specializing in retro and import gaming.  The Pink Godzilla Dev Kit is a uniquely themed rummy-style card game in which the player uses the Pink Godzilla mascot character (and friends) to create videogames.

The response I got from just about everyone I talked to was overwhelmingly positive and encouraging.  At PAX this year the Dev Kit game itself was purchasable from Pink Godzilla's rather sizable booth tucked away in the corner near a few high traffic booths.  The game was playable in one of the table-top rooms that was just about dedicated to the game.  Just about everyone I talked to at least noticed the game and the majority of those had actual tried their hand at it, and I didn't hear a single bad word about the game from anyone that had played it.

More to come, probably, as I continue to decompress and shake off the remaining jet lag.
