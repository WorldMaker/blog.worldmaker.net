title: Lebowski Fest Hits Seattle
---
While I was in Redmond I wore my Lebowski Fest "Achiever" shirt several times and got a wide variety of responses.  Lo and behold the next Lebowski Fest in the West Coast will be `Lebowski Fest Seattle <http://www.lebowskifest.com/seattle07.asp>`_.  Maybe a few of the people I mentioned it to might even attend.  (Coincidence enough the pre-bowling concert will be in The Showbox which was the last venue I visited before I left the Seattle area in the Fall.)
