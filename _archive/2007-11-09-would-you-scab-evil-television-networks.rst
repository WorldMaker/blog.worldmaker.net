title: Would you scab for the evil television networks?
---
I was discussing the other day about the current Writer's Guild strike and how I support it, mentioning that in support I'm not working on any television or film projects, either.  Not that I had any in the works in the first place, though.  So the question was asked, if I was given a rather large advance to work on a project like, for example, writing for the cheap-o Office spin-off that NBC is trying to hastily put together lest we forget how much we like the Office when it becomes one of the first big sitcoms to go on hiatus due to the strike, would I take it?  Sure, but I realized that as soon as that advance hit my bank account I would be a professional television writer and it would be pretty stupid of me not to join the Writer's Guild and start picketing with my fellow writers...

So, television networks, feel free to pay me a nice advance to pretend to be interested in writing for your upcoming projects that need scab writers.  Also, I have a reality show project or three I'm willing to sell.
