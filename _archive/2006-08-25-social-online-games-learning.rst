title: Social Online Games in Learning

A researcher, Yolanda Rankin from Northwestern University, is doing studies on `Evaluating Interactive Gaming as a Language Learning Tool`_ by using MMORPGs, EverQuest 2 being the particular choice, to build competence amongst English as a second language students.

It's yet another study that shows that MMORPGs as social vehicles help promote social/lingual competence.  I remember about ten years ago having the debate with someone that social games, regardless of the fact that face/manner/voice might be hidden, do indeed build useful social skills.  It's something of a common sense thing for gamers, and I think that I benefitted quite a bit from the many hours I spent playing old MUSHes/MUCKs, `Acrophobia <http://www.gamegardens.com/gardens/view_game.wm?gameid=25>`_ (still in the Top 9, woo!), and even posting crazy ideas and pompous attitudes to now `long departed forums </2006/aug/17/ye-olde-scramm-bar/>`_.   It's just great seeing more and more intelligent academic studies doing scientific verification of these good things, particularly to counterbalance some of the FUD studies like the ridiculous `Pac-Man is 62% violent`_ study.
