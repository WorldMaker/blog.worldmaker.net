title: 'Quote of the Moment: Geriatric Ancestors and their Engineering Wisdom...'
---
  When you were a kid, your grandma probably taught you the ancient proverb, "when all you have is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail."

  Actually, that's a lie. My grandma never taught me that. I just find it amusing to consider a possible future where a new generation of programmers could be raised on such nuggets of engineering wisdom from their geriatric predecessors.

Indeed.  (From `Shawn Hargreaves on XNA's Model is not a Hammer <http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2007/09/19/note-to-self-model-hammer.aspx>`_)
