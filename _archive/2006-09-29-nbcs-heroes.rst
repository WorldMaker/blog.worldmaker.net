I caught the last 15 Minutes of Heroes Genesis Part 1 and I think I'm hooked.  I think I've got something to try to "watch" on Mondays now that Hell's Kitchen is on hiatus...

I was afraid that Heroes would be even more of a soap opera than Smallville, but it seems to be very "comic book"-like in a few interesting (probably, subjective) ways.

On a completely different matter, I still can't get over Wednesday's lunch.  We went to Pomegranate in Redmond, and itb is one of the few restaurants in this area where I feel like I got what I paid for.  It was awesome fresh gourmet fusion food, with a watchable kitchen even.
