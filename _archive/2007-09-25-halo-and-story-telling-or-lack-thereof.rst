title: Halo and Story Telling (or Lack Thereof)
---
After having the beautiful story telling of Bioshock I'm trying to
prepare to get back into "traditional FPS mode" for my
("unfortunately" requisite, but not in the Bioshock awesome way but
the "how can I own a 360 and not own that" way, not that I don't like
Halo) pick-up of Halo 3 today after class.  Gabe (Penny Arcade)
linked `a cliff's notes of the Halo story so far
<http://forums.xbox.com/14748829/ShowPost.aspx>`_ that is maybe a bit
wordier than it needs to be (if I wanted to read the novels I would
read the novels, heh), but it gets the point across.  Much more
interesting to me are the videos intercutting the games' cutscenes
with some simple explanatory intertitles.  I've known since Halo 1
that there was an interesting story in the games, and I've seen a good
portion of the cutscenes before in my own play and in my watching
others play and I've even seen some of the wild exploration of Halo
thematic elements, so I can't claim to not know what Halo's story
"is".  I can claim that I forget it easily and have to be reminded
often.  Halo is an interesting FPS, but it's an awful story-telling
vehicle, particularly in contrast to Bioshock, but everything can be
pretty bad in comparison to Bioshock...

Halo's game play really is the interstices that make for intertitles
of "making your way halfway across the planet and mowing down lots of
enemies on the way".  So much of the story really is so much of the
cutscenes and the cutscenes are far enough apart that it's hard to
remember where you are in the story.  I can certainly understand why
some think that Halo has no more story than Quake, because you really
do have to be paying attention to catch it, much less retain it.

Again, it's not that I don't like Halo, I just think it could be done
so much better.  I compare it to Bioshock today, but I compared it to
Half-Life 1, which I think has slightly less story delivered but does
in more interesting ways, when Halo 1 was new.

I'm curious to see if Halo 3 draws me in more than its predecessors
did.  I'm much more used to console FPS' now, and don't have that
hang up anymore, at least.  I also actually personally own the console
this time around.
