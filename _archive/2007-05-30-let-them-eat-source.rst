title: Let Them Eat Source

I promised the source code to this webpage `about 10 months ago </2006/jul/25/new-worldmakernet/>`_ when I debuted it.  Well, I don't have everything ready, just yet, but I've started in that direction and so for those who don't mind wearing hard hats, feel free to step gingerly through the newly updated `Code.WorldMaker.net <http://code.worldmaker.net/>`_.

I'll keep slowly boot-strapping it over the next couple of weeks and when it is truly looking nice I might post a quick mention.  I'll definitely want to spend a post or two on Darcsforge, what is does, what it intends to do, and how it works.

What's working?  The Issue Tracker and Patch Tracker (and some cool cross-integration) both appear to be working.  I don't have decent WorldMaker.net versions of the Darcsforge templates, so you'll have to bear with me and these rough first steps.  (I've been doing testing in Darcsforge's clean default templates, which I like but I prefer having my personal site relatively consistently-themed.)

What's not working? The Project Map, The Repository Map, The File Browser, The Wiki, whatever other crazy applications I think should be added.
