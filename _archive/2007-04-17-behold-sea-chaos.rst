Such an inescapably fitting metaphor for so many things in life the image just spoke to me.  For those that don't know, this week is the Pre-Finals Shit Storm of Chaos (4 classes, 4 days, 4 tests)...  I'm looking forward to getting some fun in this weekend [#]_.

.. [#] Found in following Hugh's blue monster, which is a killer poster-meme floating through Microsoft bloggers right now.  The blue monster (captioned with the words "Change the World or Go Home") says quite succinctly something that is a great part of the Microsoft culture that sometimes gets forgotten or hidden in plain sight.  On a semi-related note, I'm very tempted by this somewhat similar and related `business/blog card <http://gapingvoid.streetcards.com/streetcards_pz2.php?uploading=0&card_id=1456>`_.

.. [#] At the very least I'll definitely be at the spring game.  I still haven't yet decided whether or not to hit the Waterfront-scene Saturday for Thunder...  I'd like to...  Hopefully someone else is interested in going and willing to help push me to go...
