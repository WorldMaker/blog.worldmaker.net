title: The Big Lebowski Phonetic Alphabet
---
I missed this year's `Lebowski Fest <http://lebowskifest.com>`_ due to the whole being several thousand miles away and what have you...  Anyway, some telephone service provider has decided to attempt to replace the NATO phonetic alphabet with one much more fun to mindlessly repeat, like say a `Big Lebowski Phonetic Alphabet <http://www.grupthink.com/topic/2497>`_.
