title: Teller's MacBeth
---
I've been reading the essays about the production of `Teller's MacBeth`_ (via Niel Gaiman's blog) and I'm salivating...  it sounds like so much fun and there are just some great bits and pieces in the essays.  I wish I was closer to New Jersey or DC to actually catch a show.  The DC performance lasts through my Spring Break and I'm starting to wonder if that might not be an excuse to visit DC for the break...
