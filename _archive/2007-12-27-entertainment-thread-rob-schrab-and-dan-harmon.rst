title: 'Entertainment Thread: Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon'
---
It's a small entertainment world, particularly the actually funny, weird stuff.  Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon seem to be pretty cool, weird and funny guys.  Co-founders of Channel101_ and involved in an interesting list of projects including `Robot Bastard`_, *Heat Vision and Jack* (apparently a feature-film is in the works), and *The Sarah Silverman Show*.  I finally cleared Doug TenNapel's (creator of much of *Earthworm Jim* and *The Neverhood*) graphic novels out of my Amazon wishlist and onto my shelf and Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon are credited for bringing him into comics.  It was weird when I finally noticed their credits in *The Sarah Silverman Show*, which I think is the best actual sit-com in years.  I turned to my brother when I noticed it and said, "Yeah, you remember, those were the guys that did *Laser Fart*."
