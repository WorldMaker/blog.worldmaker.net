title: Matriculation Get

Yesterday I sat (and walked and stood at the appropriate points in time) through the three graduation ceremony at the Kentucky International Convention Center.  I only have one grade missing on my transcript and expect that one to get filled any moment now.

But it seems that I'm done.  I've got no more plans for school in the immediate future. I've achieved my MEng degre.  I will also soon have to worry about loan repayments, insurance and all of the other fun stuff of trying to make it in the "real" world.  I need to follow back up with my job search leads, soon...  Maybe I'll get a couple of my own projects to the point where they might generate at least some small, tiny amount of income.

But first maybe I'll play some games and try to at least celebrate a little...
