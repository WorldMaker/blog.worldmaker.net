title: NYC Vacation Photos
---
I've uploaded the photos from my `NYC vacation <http://tags.worldmaker.net/nyc/>`_ with my family.  We had some fun, some anger, copious amounts of subway time, and some great food.  There are quite a few photos of my little sister, Grace, who also happened to take some of the photos and is excited to have photos on at least one of the internets.  I promised to show her how to make a simple website if I get a chance this week.  To recap: I flew back to Louisville on the 31st of July.  Flew to NYC on the 5th of August for a vacation with my family.  Flew back to Louisville today (the 13th of Aug).  Will fly back to Seattle/Redmond on Saturday (August 19th).  12 Weeks out there, and then I'll be back in Louisville in time for Thanksgiving, giving me a pretty nice "break" between then and the start of the Spring semester of classes.

(Also uploaded were photos of the `beerrow <http://tags.worldmaker.net/beerrow/>`_ I created of some of the bottle caps from the (mainly) beers that I drank over the Summer.  Most of them are micro-brews, as is my preference.)
