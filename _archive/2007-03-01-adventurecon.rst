I'm certainly tempted by `AdventureCon <http://www.adventurecon.org/>`_, but I'm afraid I probably won't be able to make it without some sort of sponsorship.  It has three major names already signed up to appear: Scott Adams, Al Lowe, and Jane Jensen.  It is attempting to capitalize on the amazing convergence that this year marks both the 30th anniversary of Zork and the 20th anniversary of Leisure Suit Larry.
