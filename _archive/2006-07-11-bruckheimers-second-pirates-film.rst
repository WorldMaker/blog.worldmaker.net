title: Bruckheimer's Second Pirates Film
---
I was much less angered by the "just wait for part 2" ending of Pirates 2, than any of the guys I went with.  I thought it was a good action film, and I didn't have anywhere near as much pain sitting through it than I had trying to watch X-Men 3.  Perhaps because I didn't expect much.  I'd probably see the 3rd when it hits theaters.

My lone disappointment, and it's a bit minor, was that I wanted to see the musical score reference `The Flying Dutchman Overture <http://www.opuscds.com/track/71938>`_.
