Just uploaded the latest ``musdex`` (10.04.04) to PyPI and making a quick note here. 10.04.04 is a somewhat significant refactor of ``musdex``, which won't have too many obvious differences without a bit of configuration changing. The new additions is a customizable handler system that will allow for support for other archive formats (beyond just Zip archives), and a customizable way to specify post-extraction "formatters" to make extracted files even more useful under source control. There are no new handlers yet (although I'm considering building an SQLite one for proof-of-concept), but two built-in formatters that can opted in: ``xmllint`` and ``remove_carriage_returns``. Details in the documentation including the basics you will need to build a custom formatter or handler.
