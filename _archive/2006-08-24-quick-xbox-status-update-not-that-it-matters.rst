title: Quick Xbox Status Update (not that it matters)

I realize some might be worried about my oh so sad situation of not having more games than Hexic, but that was corrected only a few hours after that post.  A coworker of mine let me borrow some of her company store quota to purchase a game to keep Hexic company.  I've since scored 4 more achievements (made it through to the end of the second major level in Kameo) that I can't yet show off.
