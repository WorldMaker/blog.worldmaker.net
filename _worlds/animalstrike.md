Mostly the fevered excuse for a very weird collection of Mech-style game ideas.  The general plotline (which I know realize sounds like a really bad Japanese manga series or something): followed something of an near-total-ecological-collapse many of the remaining species of animals on Earth had been "uplifted" to sentient or near-sentient states.  (Not furry mind you, more "Cyborg-squirrels attack!" if you will...)  Throw in some political drama and some crazy over-mechanized warfare (and time travel), to taste.
